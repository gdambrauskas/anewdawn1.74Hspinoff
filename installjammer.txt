A New Dawn is not a stand alone mod, so it requires many existing files provided by Rise of Mankind to work properly. The correct way to get a test copy of A New Dawn
working is by following this layout:

1.) Download Installjammer, the free open source tool used to create the A New Dawn installer
(http://www.installjammer.com/download)

2.) Install Installjammer and launch it.

3.) In the file menu, select "Open"

4.) Change the box in the lower right corner from "InstallJammer Project Files" to "All Files".

5.) Navigate to the location of the "A New Dawn Install Script" and open it. It will take a few seconds to load (It's pretty large)

6.) In the "Build Installers" tab, select "Build Install" It will appear like Installjammer has frozen. This is normal. Wait about 5 minutes, then a progress bar should appear, and 5 more minutes later, it will complete. (Packing ~250 mb takes time)

7.) Run the installer!

Keep in the mind that the CvGameCoreDLL is usually out of date. You will need to compile a new version for most revisions.
