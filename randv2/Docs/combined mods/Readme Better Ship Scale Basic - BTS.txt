Better Ship Scale Basic - BTS

Description:

This minor mod changes the scale between ships, making modern ones bigger and the ancient ones smaller. This was something that bothered me in vainilla civ, as destroyers were substancially small than frigates...

Version History:

v1.0

- Initial Release. For BTS only.

Hope you like it!
