-------------------------------------
[B]Change Log version 2.61 to 2.7[/B]
-------------------------------------
- Updated to BUG 4.3 & BULL 1.1
- Update to BBAI 0.84 & UP 1.4
- Added Scenario Modcomp that allows loading of BtS scenarios that have less defined players then the dll (default BtS scenarios now playable with RevDCM)  -Thanks Tamudjin!
- Added Afforess's Python callbacks (should improve performance)
- Added many, many translations; RevDCM should be nearly entirely translated in German, and well polished in Italian (Thanks Snophru & Gaplus)
- Swapped out old Civic Screen with RoM's Civic Screen, removes needed SDK functions and is much simpler
- Normalized Loading of Revolution.ini with other BUG components (fixes user specific loss of interface bug)
- Movies defined for any building now work correctly. Designed with big mods in mind:  Wonder splash only occurs for buildings that have a movie defined, and World Wonders.  -updated to be a BUG module (thanks Lemon Merchant)
- Packed art into fpk
- Added HasMet check to Worst Enemy trading penalty
- AI razing decisions greatly improved and AI takes into account the effects of IDW; it may now raze cities with IDW enabled
- Added new value to the GlobalDefinesAlt file "IDW_CITY_TILE_MULTIPLIER", which allows changing the effects of IDW on city tiles; default is 0.2 which means that in cities IDW effect is 1/5th of normal
- Updated Credits screen in the BUG options tab to reflect this is RevDCM, and not BUG
- Fixed bug with tech diffusion and AI's trade denials (thanks Afforess)
- Fixed Python Error "newCividx is not defined"
- Removed WoC UnitResource Icons
- Improved Tech grant for Barb civs, new World Barbarian civs shouldn't be so advanced
- Changed all inquisitor code to a Softcoded format handled in the XML (see UnitInfos for relevant tags).  Fixed many bugs in Inquisitions code.
- Inquisitions moved entirely into the SDK (thanks Afforess)
- Multiplayer code from the RevolutionMP project ported over, MP is still somewhat buggy and may not connect properly for all users, but should at least "work" in general
	*Direct IP connections should work for most players (but some players are unable to connect for some unkown reason), Gamespy connections have not been tested
	*Players must ensure that they have set the same options in the RevDCM options tab, any different options selected in this tab will cause OOS issues
	*BarbarianCiv, BarbarianWorld, Dynamic Civ Names, Tech diffusion, and Start as Minors options have been tested and seem to function without issue
	*Revolutions will work for the most part, however if a player chooses to switch leaders or take control of Rebels due to a Revolution pop up, an instantanious OOS will occur
	*When a human player dies the game will go OOS; all living players will need to reload the game and the dead player must drop to correct
- Wrote install script for RevDCM
	*Allows easy installation for all users, and insures correct intallation
	*Elinates need for "launch as admin", and elimnates some rare user specific crash to desktops
	*automatically tests for 3.19 patch
	*allows creation of easy to use shortcuts for easy accessibility to the mod
- Created New Installer options, moved a few RevDCM default components into being optional
	*Dale's Nuclear changes, such as the chain reactor and atomic bomber; brings RevDCM in line with default BtS
	*Better Ship Scale WoC module; makes it so launching as admin is not necessary with new installer, since WoC modules require admin privlages to work correctly
	*Choose Religions; multiple confirmed bug reports caused by conflicts with the Pick Religions gameoption, and this python component
- Added a few XML tags to make things easier on mod modders and necessary for new inquisitions code to work
	*FeatureInfos:
		GrowthSound:  allows modders to set a specific sound for feature growth, rather then always getting the forest sound
	*CivicInfos:
		bUpgradeAnywhere:  allows units to upgrade outside national borders (Cloned from TraitInfos, introduced in previous RevDCM version)
		bAllowInquisitions:  Defines a civic as enabling inquisitions
		bDisallowInquisitions:  Defines a civic as disabling inquisitions (overrides all other conditions)
	*UnitInfos:
		bForceObsoleteTech: makes a unit untrainable when a defined tech is learned
		bInquisitor: Unit can run inquisitions missions if inquisitions conditions are met
		bStateReligion:  State relgion required in city to train unit
		PrereqGameOption:  If set, gameoption required to be enabled in the game for the unit to be trained
		NotGameOption:  If set, the unit may not be trained if the specified gameoption is selected
		PrereqOrCivics:  If set, the unit my only be trained if the player is running one of the specified civics
		PrereqBuildingClasses:  If set, the unit may only be trained if specified buildingclasses have been built in the city
