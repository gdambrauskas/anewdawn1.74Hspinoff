[B]Installation Instructions[/B]
_________________________

Better BTS AI requires Civ4: Beyond the Sword patched to 3.19.  There are two ways to use Better BTS AI:

1	As a mod.  Place the Better BTS AI folder which contains this readme and the Assets folder in "C:\Program Files\Firaxis Games\Sid Meier's Civilization 4\Beyond the Sword\Mods\".  You can then load Better BTS AI as a mod in the normal way or set BTS to autoload Better BTS AI in "\My Games\Beyond the Sword\CivilizationIV.ini".  This method maintains compatibility for online play but the changes in Better BTS AI will only apply when the mod is running (not in other mods, Firaxis scenarios).  [B]Recommended if[/B] you want to easily go back to standard BTS or play online.

2	Replace default files.  The contents of the Assets folder are intended to replace the files located in the same locations in "C:\Program Files\Firaxis Games\Sid Meier's Civilization 4\Beyond the Sword\Assets\".  It is recommended that you backup your current dll and other files which will be replaced (renaming them will work fine) before installing this version.  When the game is not running, simply paste the contents the mod's Assets folder into the same locations in BTS's Assets folder.  This method will make the Better BTS AI changes always apply unless you load a mod with its own DLL.  For online play everyone must have installed Better BTS AI in this way or things may not work correctly.  [B]Recommended if[/B] you always want to use Better BTS AI.

The source code for the changes is also included in a zip.  If you are not a modder, you do not need those files and there is no need to extract them from the zip file.


[B]New User Interface Features[/B]
_________________________

- Holding down SHIFT+ALT and clicking on a leader in the scoreboard toggles your civ's warplan between WARPLAN_PREPARING_TOTAL and NO_WARPLAN.  This feature can be used to signal to your vassals that they should begin preparing for war with a particular player as well, allowing them to be much better prepared when you declare.  Any warning you can give your vassals will help, but enough time to build one to two units in a city is best.  WARNING: Use of this feature is not multiplayer compatible, WARPLANs are not sent across the network since they're otherwise only used by the AI and so it will lead to OOS errors if you have vassals.
- The scoreboard will show WAR in yellow instead of red when you have declared you are planning a war using the above feature.
- Added line to contact help text explaining that SHIFT+ALT clicking toggles war preparation plans.
- Air units can now be set to explore, they use the same explore logic as AI planes and then have additional logic if that doesn't push a mission.  Note that planes on auto explore always move at the very beginning of your turn!


[B]Customization[/B]
_________________________

Some mod options can be enabled or disabled by changing settings in GlobalDefinesAlt.xml.  Here are the important options in that file:

- BBAI_AIR_COMBAT:  Controls modification for air v air combat to make veteran units more valuable, especially when wounded.  Air v air combat is now more much more similar to land combat.  Defaults to ON.
- BBAI_HUMAN_VASSAL_WAR_BUILD:  This setting makes vassals of human players build more military units, anticipating that their human masters will engage in more wars.  In single player, it's better to use the new SHIFT+ALT click feature to set war preparation plans described above, this is intended mainly for multiplayer where that feature should not be used.  Defaults to OFF.


[B]Merge instructions[/B]
_________________________

DLL:  If the other mod has a custom DLL, you will need to merge the source code and complie a new DLL.  If you don't know what this means, ask for help from the community.

Python:  Only the file in Assets\Python\Screens\ contains a fix, the other Python files are only to facilitate testing.  AIAutoPlay and ChangePlayer are very useful for general testing, so consider including them.  Tester contains some test popups specific to this mod.  These components use DrElmerGiggles custom event manager to manage their subscriptions to different Python events.

XML:  Most XML changes are fixes from the unofficial patch, if you already have these changes then you are fine, otherwise you should merge them.  The exceptions to this are GlobalDefinesAlt.xml (which has updated AI variables), and two files with game text, Text\CIV4GameText_BetterBTSAI.xml and Text\CIV4GameText_AIAutoPlay.xml.  You will want to copy these files over, although the AIAutoPlay text is only needed if you also are using the AIAutoPlay python component.


[B]Debug Keyboard Commands[/B]
_________________________

This mod includes the AIAutoPlay and ChangePlayer debug suites from the Revolution mod.  These commands are intended to help debug the game plus are also kind of fun (if you're not playing for real):

Ctrl+Shift+X    AIAutoPlay      Opens popup to start automation for any number of turns.  Pressing while in automation cancels automation.
Ctrl+Shift+M    AIAutoPlay      Automate the rest of the current turn only.
Ctrl+Shift+P    ChangePlayer    Open popup to change the civ and leader type for any player in the game.
Ctrl+Shift+L    ChangePlayer    Open popup to switch which player the human controls.
