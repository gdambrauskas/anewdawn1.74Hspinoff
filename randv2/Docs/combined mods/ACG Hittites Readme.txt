INSTALLATION
------------
Extract this file to your Warlords "Mods" folder within the game directory. For example, C:\Program Files\Firaxis Games\Sid Meier's Civilization 4\Warlords\MODS. It should create a folder called "ACG Hittites" that will include all of the modified files. In game, click on "Advanced" and then "Load a Mod" to play. 

If you want this mod to load automatically every time you play Civ4 Warlords then edit the "CivilizationIV.ini" file in your "\My Documents\My Games\Warlords" directory. Search for "Mod = 0" and change it to "Mod = Mods\ACG Hittites". 

For easier copying & pasting into your own modpack, I've noted changes made by me to the xml files in the "XML Changes.txt" file.
