Python
------
- Added: OOSLogger (for logging Out of Sync errors in multiplayer games)
- Added: CvDiplomacy.py human player can now refuse to talk to other civs with "Cease bothering us!" comment, Player can ask the AI to cease contacting them. If the AI wants to contact the human player but has been told not to, the AI will behave as if the human player had rejected whatever request the AI was intending to make. This may either be no change in attitude, a change in attitude or perhaps an unexpected war declaration as well! All war declaration diplomacy contact and first contact meetings are not affected by this option.  The AI behaviour is 100% BTS behaviour equivalent and so there is no change in the AI behaviour. The change is actually only an interface enhancement useful to the human player when there are a lot of insignificant AI's about that the human player does not want to communicate with. The do not bother status is not saved in the game state, so reloading or restarting will reset all do not bother status to back to vanilla contact behaviour. This is good, because there is a high likelihood that players will forget that they have told the AI to shut up between gaming sessions, and thus are wide open to unexpected surprises in diplomacy.

Bonus classes
-------------
New classes should help AI players and make them value more resources as they want resources from all bonus classes, General class had many resources so AI did not value them much if they already had access to 1 or more of those resources. Adding more classes also affects Mapgenerator because it decides to place resources based on what bonus class they belong to and same type resources usually aren't close to each other. This should help to problem where maps were generated without some important resources.
