This leaderhead is a converted model from Atlantica Online. Therefore, I take no credit for the artwork and all rights are within NDOORS Corporation of course.

This leaderhead uses the Isabella animations It's completely modular. All files in the zip-file are already put into the necessary folders, unzipping it directly in the Mods folder of BtS should result into a working mod. The leaderhead has a polycount of about 4400 triangles. There are one noshader and two shader leaderhead (outdoor and indoor) included. To change the outdoor version into the indoor one exchange the isabella.nif and the isabella_bg.dds with the "indoor_" versions.
