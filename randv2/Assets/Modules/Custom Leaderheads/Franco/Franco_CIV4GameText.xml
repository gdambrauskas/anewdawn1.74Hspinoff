		<English>[H1]Francisco Franco[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Spanish Head of State[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] 1892 - 1975[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Francisco Paulino Hermenegildo Teódulo Franco y Bahamonde, commonly known as Francisco Franco or Francisco Franco y Bahamonde was the dictator and later formally became head of state of Nationalist Spain from October 1936, and of all of Spain from 1939 until his death in 1975. His state combined early twentieth-century corporatism with nationalism and some aspects of fascism and a focus on traditional values. From 1947 to his death he was de facto regent of Spain.[PARAGRAPH:1]Franco led a successful military career and reached the rank of General. He fought in Morocco and suppressed a strike in 1934 to defend the Republican government's stability. In February 1936, the left-wing Popular Front won the general election and formed a government. A period of severe instability and disarray followed the election, with escalating violence between left and right wing supporters. Anti-clerical violence against the Church by leftist militants further raised tensions. After the assassination of a major opposition figure, José Calvo Sotelo, by a commando unit of the Assault Guards in July 1936, Franco participated in a coup d'etat against the elected Popular Front government. The coup failed and evolved into the Spanish Civil War during which he emerged as the leader of the Nationalists against the Popular Front. After winning the civil war, he dissolved the Spanish Parliament, establishing an authoritarian regime that lasted until 1978, when a new constitution was drafted. During the Second World War, Franco maintained a policy of neutrality, although he did assist Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy on a small scale against the Soviet Union, most famously by sending troops (known as the Blue Division) to aid Nazi Germany in fighting the USSR. Before the invasion of the Soviet Union by the German Army, Franco and Hitler met in Hendaye on October 23, 1940. During the Cold War, the United States established a diplomatic alliance with Franco, due to his strong anti-Communist policy. American President Richard Nixon toasted Franco [2], and, after Franco's death, stated: "General Franco was a loyal friend and ally of the United States." After his death Spain began a transition to democracy.</English>
