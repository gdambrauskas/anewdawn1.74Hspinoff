		<English>[TAB] The lemon, Citrus × limon, is a citrus tree, a hybrid of cultivated origin. The fruit are cultivated primarily for their juice, though the pulp and rind (zest) are also used, primarily in cooking or mixing. Lemon juice is about 5% citric acid, which gives lemons a sour taste. This is a small tree, grows to 6 m (20 ft) but usually smaller. The branches are thorny, and form an open crown. The leaves are elliptical-acuminate. Flowers are violet and streaked in the interior and white on the outside. On a lemon tree, flowers and ripe fruits can be found at the same time. The first description of the lemon, which had been introduced from India two centuries earlier, is found in Arabic writings from the 12th century. The origin of the name lemon is through Persian (____ Limu), from the Sanskrit nimbuka. They were cultivated in Genoa in the mid-fifteenth century, and appeared in the Azores in 1494. More recent research has identified lemons in the ruins of Pompeii. Lemons were once used by the British Royal navy to combat scurvy, as they provided a large amount of vitamin C. - Wikipedia </English>

		<German>[TAB] Die Zitrone (Citrus limon) ist eine Zitruspflanze mit etwa faustgro&#223;er Frucht, l&#228;nglich-oval mit gelber oder gr&#252;n-gelber Schale, Fruchtfleisch mit sehr saurem Geschmack (Zitronens&#228;ure) und hohem Vitamin C-Anteil. Zitronensaft wird (ges&#252;&#223;t) vielf&#228;ltig f&#252;r die Zubereitung von Speisen und Getr&#228;nken verwendet. Die Zitrusfamilie stammt aus S&#252;dostasien mit subtropisch bis tropischem Klima. Dort gibt es sehr viele verschiedene Sorten und Arten. Von dort aus haben sie sich im Laufe der Jahrhunderte verbreitet. Es ist anzunehmen, dass dies in erster Linie durch Menschenhand bewerkstelligt wurde ( Seidenstrasse ). Heute finden wir die Familie der Zitrusb&#228;ume in allen Kontinenten. Die ersten Ausleseerfolge gab es im chinesischen Kaiserreich, denn allein der Kaiser durfte diese g&#246;ttliche Frucht, die Mandarine essen. Sie gab auch den Ministern den Namen Mandarin. Poncirus trifoliata, eine der frostharten Zitruspflanzen k&#246;nnte dort entstanden sein. Von den R&#246;mern wissen wir, dass sie eine bitter schmeckende Zitrusfrucht innerhalb von 100 Jahren zu einer vielfach genie&#223;baren Frucht umwandelten. (Citrus medica) Im 10. Jahrhundert n. Chr. brachten die Mauren die Pomeranzen ( eine saure Orange ) nach Europa, insbesondere nach Sizilien und S&#252;dspanien. Modernere Zucht- und Ausleseerfolge fanden im Mittelalter in den Klosterg&#228;rten Europas statt. - Wikipedia </German>

		<English>[TAB] The potato (plural form: potatoes) (Solanum tuberosum) is a perennial plant of the Solanaceae, or nightshade, family, grown for its starchy tuber. In recent centuries potatoes have become the world's most important tuber crop and its fourth most important source of food energy (after rice, wheat, and maize): farmers and gardeners grow them world-wide. Growers cultivate thousands of different varieties of potato. The potato originated in the Andes, in the area of present-day Peru. Pre-Columbian inhabitants of the Andean cultures cultivated around 200 different kinds of potatoes. Archeological evidence suggests that humans have cultivated the potato for at least 7,000 years. By the seventeenth century the potato had become firmly established as a staple of Europe's poor, leading richer people to spurn it, although this changed gradually, with Antoine-Augustin Parmentier's persuading King Louis XVI of France of the value of the crop. The soup potage Parmentier takes its name from the great horticulturalist. By the end of the 18th century the potato had become popular in France, due to the advocacy of Parmentier. Today, potatoes grow widely in Europe, especially in North European countries such as the British Isles, Germany, Poland, and Russia, due to their ability to thrive in cold, damp climates. Because the potato grew so well in Northern Europe, it may have contributed to the population-explosion there in the 19th century - though not in other centuries. - Wikipedia </English>

		<German>[TAB] Die Kartoffel (Solanum tuberosum), auch Erdapfel oder Speisekartoffel ist eine Pflanzenart in der Gattung Nachtschatten (Solanum) und wird daher der Familie der Nachtschattengew&#228;chse (Solanaceae) zugerechnet. Weltweit werden j&#228;hrlich etwa 300 Millionen Tonnen Kartoffeln geerntet. Die Kartoffel ist damit in gro&#223;en Teilen der Welt ein wichtiges Grundnahrungsmittel. In Mitteleuropa ist sie sogar das Hauptgrundnahrungsmittel. Die Kartoffel stammt aus den s&#252;damerikanischen Anden. Dort lernten die Spanier in der ersten H&#228;lfte des 16. Jahrhunderts von den Inka die Frucht Papa (aus Quechua: die Knolle) kennen. In Europa angekommen, zun&#228;chst auf den Kanarischen Inseln und in Andalusien, wurde sie Patata genannt _ der englische Name potatoes oder der franz&#246;sische Spitzname patate erinnern noch heute daran, ebenso wie die alte deutsche Bezeichnung Batate, die heute die S&#252;&#223;kartoffel bezeichnet. Der gebr&#228;uchliche deutsche Name Kartoffel erinnert dagegen an Tr&#252;ffel, italienisch tartufolo, mit denen die Pflanze am Anfang verglichen wurden. Der franz&#246;sische Ausdruck pomme de terre bedeutet hingegen Erdapfel _ ein auch in &#214;sterreich und der Schweiz gebr&#228;uchlicher Name. Nach Europa wurde die Kartoffel zuerst wegen der sch&#246;nen Bl&#252;te und des &#252;ppigen Laubes als reine Zierpflanze importiert und als seltene Pflanze in botanische G&#228;rten aufgenommen. Die &#228;ltesten Spuren der Wildkartoffel wurden auf der patagonischen Insel Chiloe gefunden, man sch&#228;tzt ihr Alter auf 13000 Jahre vor Chr. - Wikipedia </German>

		<English>[TAB] Coffee is a drink, usually hot, prepared from the roasted seeds of the coffee plant. These seeds are usually called coffee beans. Coffee is the second most traded commodity in the world, trailing only petroleum. Coffee is one of humanity's chief sources of caffeine, a stimulant. Coffee bean ranks as one of the world's major commodity crops and is the major export product of some countries. In fact, coffee ranks third only to cocoa and oil in terms of legally-traded products worldwide. One apocryphal tale claims that an Ethiopian goat-herder noticed his goats prancing about energetically, and found they were eating coffee berries, and tried some himself. The crop first became popular in Arabia around the 13th century, and Islam's prohibition against alcoholic beverages probably enhanced its popularity. Before 1600, coffee production was a jealously guarded secret, and fertile beans were not found outside Arabia. Many consider the German botanist Leonhard Rauwolf to have first described coffee in a book published in 1583. Sometime after 1600, coffee trees were grown in India, possibly due to smuggling of fertile beans. Around 1650, coffee importation into England began and coffeehouses opened in Oxford and London. By the 18th century, the beverage had become popular in Europe, and European colonists had introduced coffee to tropical countries worldwide as a plantation crop to supply domestic demand. At the end of the 19th century, plantations in Brazil alone were producing over 80% of the world's coffee crop.- Wikipedia</English>

		<German>[TAB] Kaffee ist ein schwarzes, koffeinhaltiges Hei&#223;getr&#228;nk, das aus ger&#246;steten (R&#246;stkaffee) und gemahlenen Kaffeebohnen hergestellt wird. R&#246;st- und Mahlgrad variieren je nach Zubereitungsart (s. u.). Kaffee enth&#228;lt das Vitamin Niacin. Nach einer 1671 zu Papier gebrachten Legende fiel einst Hirten aus Kaffa auf, dass ein Teil der Ziegenherde, die von einem Strauch mit wei&#223;en Bl&#252;ten und roten Fr&#252;chten gefressen hatten, bis in die Nacht hinein munter umhersprang, w&#228;hrend die anderen Tiere m&#252;de waren. Die Hirten beklagten sich dar&#252;ber bei M&#246;nchen des nahe gelegenen Klosters. Als ein Hirte selbst die Fr&#252;chte des Strauchs versuchte, stellte er auch bei sich eine belebende Wirkung fest. Bei Nachforschungen der M&#246;nche an der Grasungsstelle entdeckten sie dort einige dunkelgr&#252;ne Pflanzen mit kirschenartigen Fr&#252;chten. Sie bereiteten daraus einen Aufguss und konnten fortan ohne das gewohnte Schlafbed&#252;rfnis bis tief in die Nacht hinein wach sein, beten und miteinander reden. Somit haben wohl Ziegen die Kaffeebohne entdeckt. Es wird angenommen, dass die Provinz Kaffa in &#196;thiopien das Ursprungsland des Kaffees ist. Dort wurde er bereits im 9. Jahrhundert erw&#228;hnt. Von &#196;thiopien gelangte der Kaffee vermutlich im 14. Jahrhundert durch Sklavenh&#228;ndler nach Arabien. Ger&#246;stet und getrunken wurde er aber dort wahrscheinlich erst ab Mitte des 15. Jahrhunderts. Der Kaffeeanbau brachte Arabien eine Monopolrolle ein. Handelszentrum war die Hafenstadt Mocha, auch Mokka genannt, das heutige Al Mukha im Jemen. - Wikipedia </German>

		<English>[TAB] Edible salt is a mineral, one of the few rocks humans eat. Salt is necessary for the survival of all living creatures, including humans. Salt is involved in regulating the water content (fluid balance) of the body. Salt flavor is one of the basic tastes. In the past, salt was difficult to obtain, but had a great importance in food preservation and as a vital food additive. Therefore, it was a highly valued trade item throughout history. Wars were fought over it; states were formed and destroyed because of it. Roman soldiers were partially paid with salt, and this is still evident in the English language as the word salary derives from the Latin word salarium that means payment in salt (Latin sal), as well as the phrase "worth one's salt". It was also of high value to the Hebrews, Greeks and other peoples of antiquity. During the late Roman Empire and throughout the Middle Ages salt was a precious commodity carried along the salt roads into the heartland of the Germanic tribes. Cities, states and dukedoms along the salt roads exacted heavy duties and taxes for the salt passing through their territories. This practice caused wars, it even caused the formation of cities such as the city of Munich in 1158 when the then Duke of Bavaria Henry XII, called The Lion, decided that the bishops of Freising no longer needed their salt revenue. - Wikipedia </English>

Au&#223;er zur individuellen W&#252;rzung ist Speisesalz bei der Herstellung von Fleisch- und Wurstwaren, Brot und K&#228;se unentbehrlich.

Aus Salzstra&#223;en wurden sp&#228;ter bedeutende Handelsstra&#223;en. Der Salzhandel war in Deutschland bis 1993 mit der Salzsteuer belegt. Der Handel mit Salz war ein wichtiges Monopol. St&#228;dte, die das Salzregal besa&#223;en, wachten sehr aufmerksam dar&#252;ber, dass innerhalb dessen Geltungsbereiches kein anderer Salzhandel stattfand. Eine weit verbreitete, bereits seit dem Altertum bekannte Methode ist dabei das Ausf&#228;llen von Salz durch verschiedene Verdunstungsarten aus salzhaltigen L&#246;sungen. Durch das Auswaschen und Filtrieren salziger Erde und anschlie&#223;ende Einkochen wurde in S&#252;damerika ebenfalls Salz gewonnen.

		<English>[TAB] Sulfur, in its native form, is a yellow crystaline solid. In nature, it can be found as the pure element or as sulfide and sulfate minerals. It is an essential element for life and is found in two amino acids. Its commercial uses are primarily in fertilizers but it is also widely used in gunpowder, matches, insecticides and fungicides. Gunpowder, whether black powder or smokeless powder, is a substance that burns very rapidly and is used as a propellant in firearms. As it burns, a subsonic deflagration wave is produced rather than the supersonic detonation wave which high explosives would produce. The first type of gunpowder was black powder. Historians of various cultures have postulated that it was invented between the seventh or ninth centuries by either the Arabs or the Chinese. It is also possible that black powder was invented by many cultures at around the same time. Regardless of origin, it was the first chemical propellant and the first explosive recorded in history. Black powder is a mix of sulphur, charcoal, and potassium or sodium nitrate, (sodium nitrate makes a less powerful compound), at a ratio of approximately 10:15:75. Historically, potassium nitrate was extracted from manure by a process superficially similar to composting. Nitre beds took about a year to produce crystallized potassium nitrate. - Wikipedia </English>

Schwarzpulver besteht aus einer Mischung von 75% Kaliumnitrat, 15% Holzkohle, vornehmlich aus dem Holz des Faulbaums gewonnen, und 10% Schwefel, welcher absolut s&#228;urefrei sein muss. Salpeter dient als Sauerstofflieferant, Kohlepulver als Brennstoff und Schwefel als Brennstoff und Sensibilisierer, damit es bei kleinster Ber&#252;hrung mit Funken zu brennen anf&#228;ngt. Diese Bestandteile m&#252;ssen fein zermahlen und gleichm&#228;&#223;ig vermischt werden, wobei jeder Vorgang mehrere Stunden dauert und meistens in einer Pulverm&#252;hle geschieht. Danach wird das Gemisch in so genannte Kuchen feucht verpresst und getrocknet, die wiederum zersto&#223;en bzw. gek&#246;rnt werden. So erlangt man eine gr&#246;&#223;ere Oberfl&#228;che und Abbrandgeschwindigkeit. Das fertige Pulver wird noch getrocknet und kann dann abgef&#252;llt bzw. verpackt werden. Es kann verh&#228;ltnism&#228;&#223;ig lange (luftdicht) gelagert werden. - Wikipedia </German>
		<Italian>[TAB] Sulfur, in its native form, is a yellow crystaline solid. In nature, it can be found as the pure element or as sulfide and sulfate minerals. It is an essential element for life and is found in two amino acids. Its commercial uses are primarily in fertilizers but it is also widely used in gunpowder, matches, insecticides and fungicides. Gunpowder, whether black powder or smokeless powder, is a substance that burns very rapidly and is used as a propellant in firearms. As it burns, a subsonic deflagration wave is produced rather than the supersonic detonation wave which high explosives would produce. The first type of gunpowder was black powder. Historians of various cultures have postulated that it was invented between the seventh or ninth centuries by either the Arabs or the Chinese. It is also possible that black powder was invented by many cultures at around the same time. Regardless of origin, it was the first chemical propellant and the first explosive recorded in history. Black powder is a mix of sulphur, charcoal, and potassium or sodium nitrate, (sodium nitrate makes a less powerful compound), at a ratio of approximately 10:15:75. Historically, potassium nitrate was extracted from manure by a process superficially similar to composting. Nitre beds took about a year to produce crystallized potassium nitrate. - Wikipedia </Italian>

		<English>[TAB] Hemp use dates back to the Stone Age, with hemp fibre imprints found in pottery shards in China and Taiwan[1] over 10,000 years old. These ancient Asians also used the same fibres to make clothes, shoes, ropes, and an early form of paper. 70% of the Cannabis plant's total weight is made up of the 'hurd' or woody inner core. This part of the plant is THC free and can be used in housing construction. The silica leached from the soil by the plant combined with unslaked lime forms a chemical bond similar to cement which is both fire and waterproof (see Cannabis Homes). Hemp may be grown also for food (the seed) but in the UK cultivation licences are not available for this purpose. Within Defra (the UK's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) hemp is treated as purely a non-food crop, despite the fact that seed can and does appear on the UK market as a perfectly legal food product. In Canada, hemp seed food products are common and range from carbonated beverages to frozen waffles. Many companies produce value added hemp seed items that include the oils of the seed, whole hemp grain (which is sterilized as per international law), hulled hemp seed (the whole seed without the mineral rich outer shell), hemp flour, hemp cake (a by-product of pressing the seed for oil) and hemp protein powder. Until its rediscovery in the late 1980s, the use of hemp for fibre production had declined sharply over the past decades, but hemp still occupied an important place amongst natural fibres as it is strong, durable and unaffected by water. The main uses of hemp fibre were in rope, sacking, carpet, nets and webbing. A hemp clothing industry was reborn in the West in 1988, and hemp is being used in increasing quantities in paper manufacturing. The cellulose content is about 70%. Smallholder plots are usually harvested by hand. The plants are cut at 2 to 3 cm above the soil and left on the ground to dry. Mechanical harvesting is now common, using specially adapted cutter-binders or simpler cutters. The cut hemp is laid in swathes to dry for up to four days. This was traditionally followed by retting, either water retting whereby the bundled hemp floats in water or dew retting whereby the hemp remains on the ground and is affected by the moisture in dew moisture, and by moulds and bacterial action. Modern processes use steam and machinery to separate the fibre, a process known as thermo-mechanical pulping. Fuel can be a by-product of hemp cultivation. One fuel would be biodiesel because of the oils in the seeds and stalk of the hemp, another would be bioalcohol from the fibrous stalks. - Wikipedia </English>

		<German>[TAB] Hanf (Cannabis sativa L.) ist eine der &#228;ltesten Kulturpflanzen der Welt. In China wurde er schon vor mindestens 10.000 Jahren genutzt. "Ma", wie die Chinesen den Hanf nannten, lieferte ihnen nicht nur wohlschmeckende und nahrhafte Samen, auch die St&#228;ngel mit ihren besonders langen und nahezu unverw&#252;stlichen Fasern wusste man schon fr&#252;h zu sch&#228;tzen. Bereits im Shen nung pen Ts'ao king, einem vermutlich ungef&#228;hr zu Beginn unserer Zeitrechnung verfassten chinesischen medizinischen Text, beschreibt der Autor, wie Hanf als Heilmittel gegen Malaria, Rheuma und viele andere Unp&#228;sslichkeiten eingesetzt werden kann. Die so vielseitig einsetzbare, schnell wachsende Pflanze mit ihren charakteristisch handf&#246;rmigen Bl&#228;ttern konnte nur g&#246;ttlichen Ursprungs sein. Von Buddha hei&#223;t es, er habe sich auf seinem Weg zur Erleuchtung nur von Hanfsamen ern&#228;hrt. &#220;ber Indien und die antiken Hochkulturen im heutigen Irak trat der Hanf seinen Siegeszug um die Welt an. Die alten Griechen und ihre &#228;gyptischen Nachbarn kleideten sich oft mit Hanf -- Kleidung aus Hanfgewebe wird von Herodot (450 v. Chr.) erw&#228;hnt. Hanf und Flachs waren lange Zeit die wichtigsten Faserpflanzen Europas. Aber auch die Wirkung von Cannabis-Geb&#228;ck, welches "Ausgelassenheit und Vergn&#252;gen hervorruft" (Galen, 200 n. Chr.) war bei ihnen bekannt. Kaiser Karl der Gro&#223;e erlie&#223; um 800 n. Chr. mit seiner "Capitulare" das erste Hanf-Gesetz. Es verpflichtete seine Untertanen zum Anbau dieser f&#252;r seine Kriegspl&#228;ne wichtigen Rohstoffquelle. &#220;ber Spanien fand im 13. Jahrhundert eine weitere Anwendung der Hanffaser ihren Weg nach Europa - die Papierherstellung. Da die Papierherstellung aus Holz damals noch nicht beherrscht wurde, war Hanf neben Lumpen (die selbst oft aus Hanf bestanden) der wichtigste Rohstoff f&#252;r die Papierproduktion. So entstand in N&#252;rnberg 1290 eine erste Papierm&#252;hle auf deutschem Boden. Gutenberg druckte 1455 seine ber&#252;hmte Gutenberg-Bibel auf Hanfpapier und auch die amerikanische Unabh&#228;ngigkeitserkl&#228;rung von 1776 k&#246;nnen wir nur deshalb heute noch im Original bewundern, weil sie auf fast unverw&#252;stlichem Hanfpapier verfasst wurde (und inzwischen unter Schutzgas konserviert wird). Der erste amerikanische Pr&#228;sident George Washington baute selbst im gro&#223;en Stil Hanf an. Hanfseile und Segeltuch aus Hanf waren in der Schifffahrt wichtig, da die Faser sehr widerstandsf&#228;hig gegen&#252;ber Salzwasser ist und weniger Wasser aufnimmt als beispielsweise Baumwolle. Kolumbus hatte beispielsweise 80 Tonnen Hanffasern in Form von Segeln und Tauen auf seinem Schiff, als er Amerika entdeckte. - Wikipedia </German>

		<English>[TAB] A pearl is a hard, rounded object produced by certain mollusks, primarily oysters. Pearl is valued as a gemstone and is cultivated or harvested for jewellery. Pearls are formed inside the shell of certain bivalve mollusks. As a response to an irritating object inside its shell, the mollusk will deposit layers of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in the form of the minerals aragonite or calcite (both crystalline forms of calcium carbonate) held together by an organic horn-like compound called conchiolin. Before the beginning of the 20th Century, pearl hunting was the most common way of harvesting pearls. Divers manually pulled oysters from ocean floors and river bottoms and checked them individually for pearls. Not all natural oysters produce pearls, however. In fact, in a haul of three tonnes, only three or four oysters will produce perfect pearls. Now, however, almost all pearls used for jewelry are cultured by planting a core or nucleus into pearl oysters. The pearls are usually harvested three years after the planting, but it can take up to as long as six years before a pearl is produced. This mariculture process was first developed by Kokichi Mikimoto in Japan, who was granted a patent for the process in 1896. In the past couple of decades, cultured pearls have been produced with larger oysters in the south Pacific and Indian Ocean. One of the largest pearl-bearing oysters is the Pinctada maxima, which is roughly the size of a dinner plate. South Sea pearls are characterized by their large size and silvery color. Sizes up to 14 mm in diameter are not uncommon. Australia is one of the most important sources of South Sea pearls. Tahitian pearls (also referred to as Titian pearls) are also another South Sea pearl. - Wikipedia </English>

		<English>[TAB] Cotton is a soft fiber that grows around the seeds of the Cotton plant (Gossypium spp.), a shrub native to the tropical and subtropical regions of both the Old World and the New World. The fibre is most often spun into thread and used to make a soft, breathable textile. Some authorities claim that it was likely that the Egyptians had cotton as early as 12,000 BC, and evidence has been found of cotton in Mexican caves (cotton cloth and fragments of bloody fibre interwoven with feathers and fur) which dated back to approximately 7,000 years ago.

The earliest written reference to cotton is in India. Cotton has been grown in India for more than three thousand years, and it is referred to in the Rig-Veda, written in 1500 BC. In Peru, cotton was the backbone of the development of coastal cultures such as the Moche and Nazca. Cotton was grown upriver, made into nets and traded with fishing villages along the coast for large supplies of fish. During the late mediaeval period, cotton became known as an imported fibre in northern Europe. By the end of the 16th century AD, cotton was cultivated throughout the warmer regions in Africa, Eurasia and the Americas. The Indian cotton processing industry was eclipsed during the British Industrial Revolution, when the invention of the spinning jenny (1764) and Arkwright's spinning frame (1769) enabled cheap mass-production of cotton cloth in the UK. Production capacity was further improved by the invention of the cotton gin by Eli Whitney in 1793.

		<Spanish>[TAB] Cotton is a soft fiber that grows around the seeds of the Cotton plant (Gossypium spp.), a shrub native to the tropical and subtropical regions of both the Old World and the New World. The fibre is most often spun into thread and used to make a soft, breathable textile. Some authorities claim that it was likely that the Egyptians had cotton as early as 12,000 BC, and evidence has been found of cotton in Mexican caves (cotton cloth and fragments of bloody fibre interwoven with feathers and fur) which dated back to approximately 7,000 years ago. There is clear archaeological evidence that people in South America and India domesticated different species of cotton independently thousands of years ago. The earliest written reference to cotton is in India. Cotton has been grown in India for more than three thousand years, and it is referred to in the Rig-Veda, written in 1500 BC. In Peru, cotton was the backbone of the development of coastal cultures such as the Moche and Nazca.

		<English>[TAB] Treasure is a concentration of riches, often that which is considered lost or forgotten until being rediscovered. Some jurisdictions legally define what constitutes treasure (such as in the English Treasure Act 1996). Searching for hidden treasure is a common theme in legend and fiction but real-life treasure hunters exist, and seek lost wealth for a living. Spanish treasure lost from the Spanish fleet consisted of gold, silver, jewels (especially emeralds) and also cocoa, vanilla and brazilwood (Zarin, 2005). Archaeologists are sometimes described as treasure hunters, especially those from the 19th century, although they themselves rarely wish to be associated with the term. Treasure hunters are often accused by archaeologists of pillaging ancient sites in their quests, destroying valuable information in the process. Illegal sales of antiquities to foreign buyers are also attributed to illicit treasure hunting. - Wikipedia </English>

		<English>[TAB]Glass in the common sense refers to a hard, brittle, transparent solid, such as used for windows, many bottles, or eyewear, including soda-lime glass, acrylic glass, sugar glass, isinglass (Muscovy-glass), or aluminium oxynitride. In the technical sense, glass is an inorganic product of fusion which has been cooled to a rigid condition without crystallizing. Many glasses contain silica as their main component and glass former.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ordinary glass is prevalent due to its transparency to visible light. This transparency is due to an absence of electronic transition states in the range of visible light. The homogeneity of the glass on length scales greater than the wavelength of visible light also contributes to its transparency as heterogeneities would cause light to be scattered, breaking up any coherent image transmission. Many household objects are made of glass. Drinking glasses, bowls and bottles are often made of glass, as are light bulbs, mirrors, aquaria, cathode ray tubes, computer flat panel displays, and windows.[PARAGRAPH:1]In research laboratories, flasks, test tubes, and other laboratory equipment are often made of borosilicate glass for its low coefficient of thermal expansion, giving greater resistance to thermal shock and greater accuracy in measurements. For high-temperature applications, quartz glass is used, although it is very difficult to work. Most laboratory glassware is mass-produced, but large laboratories also keep a glassblower on staff for preparing custom made glass equipment.[PARAGRAPH:1]Pure silica (SiO2) has a "glass melting point" of over 2300 Celsius (4200 Fahrenheit) degrees. While pure silica can be made into glass for special applications , other substances are added to common glass to simplify processing. One is sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), which lowers the melting point to about 1500 Celsius (2700 Fahrenheit) in soda-lime glass; "soda" refers to the original source of sodium carbonate in the soda ash obtained from certain plants. However, the soda makes the glass water soluble, which is usually undesirable, so lime (calcium oxide (CaO), generally obtained from limestone), some magnesium oxide (MgO) and aluminium oxide are added to provide for a better chemical durability. The resulting glass contains about 70 to 74 percent silica by weight and is called a soda-lime glass. Soda-lime glasses account for about 90 percent of manufactured glass.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Raw or unprocessed ("crude") oil is not useful in the form it comes in out of the ground.

Smaller molecules such as isobutane and propylene or butylenes can be recombined to meet specific octane requirements of fuels by processes such as alkylation or less commonly, dimerization. Octane grade of gasoline can also be improved by catalytic reforming, which strips hydrogen out of hydrocarbons to produce aromatics, which have much higher octane ratings. Intermediate products such as gasoils can even be reprocessed to break a heavy, long-chained oil into a lighter short-chained one, by various forms of cracking such as fluid catalytic cracking, thermal cracking, and hydrocracking.

		<English>[TAB]Steel is an alloy consisting mostly of iron, with a carbon content between 0.2 and 1.7 or 2.04% by weight depending on grade. Carbon is the most cost-effective alloying material for iron, but various other alloying elements are used such as manganese, chromium, vanadium, and tungsten. Carbon and other elements act as a hardening agent, preventing dislocations in the iron atom crystal lattice from sliding past one another. Varying the amount of alloying elements and form of their presence in the steel (solute elements, precipitated phase) controls qualities such as the hardness, ductility and tensile strength of the resulting steel.

The olive is a bitter fruit but can be eaten (usually after some kind of fermentation or curing) or used to make olive oil. It is not known exactly when olive trees first began being cultivated by humans, but they have been in use since at least 3000 BC. The olive is native to Greece and Palestine, but was later spread to the western Mediterranean and (eventually) all over the world, as it is grown today in California and Australia.[PARAGRAPH:1]Olives and olive oil both possessed special religious significance for the ancient Greeks. According to legend, the olive tree was created by the goddess Athena and used to win a contest with the god Poseidon over who would name a newly founded city; as a result of her gift of the olive, the city of Athens bears her name to this day. The ancient Greeks considered the olive to be sacred; it was a symbol of peace, wisdom, and triumph. Olive wreaths were used to crown Olympic champions. Olive oil was used in Hellenic religious ceremonies, and to this day it continues to possess a special importance in the Greek Orthodox Church. The olive continues to be of economic importance to Greece, which exports more than 400,000 tons of olive oil worldwide each year.</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_BONUS_OBSIDIAN_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB]Obsidian is a naturally occurring glass formed as an extrusive igneous rock. It is produced when felsic lava extruded from a volcano cools without crystal growth. Obsidian is commonly found within the margins of rhyolitic lava flows known as obsidian flows, where the chemical composition (high silica content) induces a high viscosity and polymerisation degree of the lava. The inhibition of atomic diffusion through this highly viscous and polymerized lava explains the lack of crystal growth. Because of the lack of crystal structure, obsidian blade edges can reach almost molecular thinness, leading to its ancient use as projectile points, and its modern use as surgical scalpel blades.[PARAGRAPH:2]Obsidian is mineral-like, but not a true mineral because as a glass it is not crystalline; in addition, its composition is too complex to comprise a single mineral. It is sometimes classified as a mineraloid. Though obsidian is dark in color similar to mafic rocks such as basalt, obsidian's composition is extremely felsic. [PARAGRAPH:2]Pure obsidian is usually dark in appearance, though the color varies depending on the presence of impurities. Iron and magnesium typically give the obsidian a dark green to brown to black color. A very few samples are nearly colorless. In some stones, the inclusion of small, white, radially clustered crystals of cristobalite in the black glass produce a blotchy or snowflake pattern (snowflake obsidian). It may contain patterns of gas bubbles remaining from the lava flow, aligned along layers created as the molten rock was flowing before being cooled. These bubbles can produce interesting effects such as a golden sheen (sheen obsidian) or a rainbow sheen (rainbow obsidian). [PARAGRAPH:2]Obsidian was valued in Stone Age cultures because, like flint, it could be fractured to produce sharp blades or arrowheads. Like all glass and some other types of naturally occurring rocks, obsidian breaks with a characteristic conchoidal fracture. It was also polished to create early mirrors. Pre-Columbian Mesoamericans' use of obsidian was extensive and sophisticated, including carved and worked obsidian for tools and decorative objects. Mesoamericans also made a type of sword with obsidian blades mounted in a wooden body. Called a macuahuitl, the weapon was capable of inflicting terrible injuries, combining the sharp cutting edge of an obsidian blade with the ragged cut of a serrated weapon. Lithic analysis can be instrumental in understanding prehispanic groups in Mesoamerica. A careful analysis of obsidian in a culture or place can be of use to reconstruct commerce, production, distribution and thereby understand economic, social and political aspects of a civilization. This is the case in Yaxchilán, a maya city where even warfare implications have been studied linked with obsidian use and its debris. [PARAGRAPH:2]Obsidian is used in cardiac surgery, as well-crafted obsidian blades have a cutting edge many times sharper than high-quality steel surgical scalpels, with the edge of the blade being only about 3 nanometres wide. Even the sharpest metal knife has a jagged, irregular blade when viewed under a strong enough microscope. When examined under an electron microscope an obsidian blade is still smooth and even. One study found that obsidian produced narrower scars, fewer inflammatory cells, and less granulation tissue in a group of rats. [PARAGRAPH:2]Obsidian is also used for ornamental purposes and as a gemstone. It possesses the property of presenting a different appearance according to the manner in which it is cut. When cut in one direction it is a beautiful jet black; when cut across another direction it is glistening gray. "Apache tears" are small rounded obsidian nuggets embedded within a grayish-white perlite matrix.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are allotropes of carbon with a cylindrical nanostructure. Nanotubes have been constructed with length-to-diameter ratio of up to 28,000,000:1, which is significantly larger than any other material. These cylindrical carbon molecules have novel properties that make them potentially useful in many applications in nanotechnology, electronics, optics and other fields of materials science, as well as potential uses in architectural fields. They exhibit extraordinary strength and unique electrical properties, and are efficient conductors of heat. Their final usage, however, may be limited by their potential toxicity.[PARAGRAPH:2]Nanotubes are members of the fullerene structural family, which also includes the spherical buckyballs. The ends of a nanotube might be capped with a hemisphere of the buckyball structure. Their name is derived from their size, since the diameter of a nanotube is on the order of a few nanometers (approximately 1/50,000th of the width of a human hair), while they can be up to several millimeters in length (as of 2008). Nanotubes are categorized as single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) and multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs).[PARAGRAPH:2]Carbon nanotubes are the strongest and stiffest materials yet discovered in terms of tensile strength and elastic modulus respectively. In 2000, a multi-walled carbon nanotube was tested to have a tensile strength of 63 gigapascals (GPa). This, for illustration, translates into the ability to endure weight of 6300 kg on a cable with cross-section of 1 square millimeter.</English>
