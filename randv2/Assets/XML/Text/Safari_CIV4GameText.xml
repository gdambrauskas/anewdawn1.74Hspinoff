		<English>Hunting was always a part of nobility as a source of recreation where they will go to the wilderness to hunt game for both food and sport. During the great age of colonialism in Africa, Europe discovered what lifeblood was during the days before they settled down: Hunting. Many aristocrats will head to parts of Africa to hunt and kill animals for sport which was considered to be trophy hunting as the creatures in Africa were much more fierce and deadly than what they had encountered in Europe ranging from elephants to lions despite controversy in. Hunting remains a recreation sport in many areas including Africa but compared to the old days where hunting laws were made to prohibit peasants from hunting certain animals during certain seasons.</English>
