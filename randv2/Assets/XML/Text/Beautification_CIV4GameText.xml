		<English>A reflecting pool or reflection pool is a structure often used in memorials. It generally consists of a shallow pool of water, usually quite calm. A design with edges being slightly deeper than the center of the pool is often used to suppress wave formation. It is sometimes designed to inspire solemnity and reflection, though, as any piece of art, the final interpretation is in the mind of the viewer.</English>
