Hong Kong’s Fast Food branches for example have implemented several Hong Kong Cuisine Classics to their menu and some places like Germany allow beer to be served in their restaurants.[PARAGRAPH:1]Built under a “Bureaucratic” factory System, food produced here is cheap, fast and filling which has been so “effective” that it has a social effect termed as “McDonaldization” where Efficiency, Calculability, Predictability and Control is what society needs.</English>
