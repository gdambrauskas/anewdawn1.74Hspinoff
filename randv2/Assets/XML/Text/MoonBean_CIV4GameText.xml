		<English>Coffee and other hot caffeinated beverages was always a vital part of societies as humans enjoy tea time with their fellow men. However, the idea of a coffee branch changed the way of the “Coffee Culture” to fit with the consumerism standards of America. With the founding of Starbucks however, the face of the coffee culture changed forever. In the year 1971, Jerry Baldwin, Zev Siegel and Gordon Bowker had started one of the biggest coffee branches in Seattle as they desired to turn coffee and tea to a sophisticated drink as they bought high quality coffee equipment and coffee beans to follow. The following result is what will be one of the biggest coffee giants in the entire world as they were able to quickly spread not only in America but in other developed nations of the world. The effect of Starbucks wasn’t their coffee but rather the new age culture it has created with special blends of coffee beverages and tea were made to cater to the tastes and whims of everyone to the artist culture that Starbucks supports as well as attempts to influence “Fair Trade” policies where developing nations can sell coffee and tea competitively with larger companies who in the age of neo-imperialism have impoverished subsistence farmers with their “Banana Republic” policies.</English>
