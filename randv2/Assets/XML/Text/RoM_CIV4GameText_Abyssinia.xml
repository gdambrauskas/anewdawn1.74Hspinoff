		<English>A stele is a stone or wooden slab, generally taller than it is wide, erected for funerary or commemorative purposes, most usually decorated with the names and titles of the deceased or living - inscribed, carved in relief, or painted onto the slab.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Stelae were also used as territorial markers, as the boundary stelae of Akhenaton at Amarna, or to commemorate military victories.

		<English>[TAB]According to tradition, the Abyssinian kingdom was founded (10th century B.C.) by Solomon's first son, Menelik I, whom the Queen of Sheba is supposed to have borne. Thus this makes Ethiopia the oldest independent country in Africa and one of the most ancient in the world. For centuries Abyssinia controlled much of the Red Sea coast and had links with the Mediterranean world. In the 4th Century under King Ezana, Abyssinia was converted to Christianity.[PARAGRAPH:2]With the rise of Islam in the 7th century, Abyssinia declined, mainly because its land contacts with the Byzantine Empire were severed and its control of the Red Sea trade routes was ended. In 1530-31, Ahmad Gran, a Muslim Somali leader, conquered much of Ethiopia. The Ethiopian emperor Lebna Dengel appealed to Portugal for help against the Somalis (a Portuguese embassy had reached the Ethiopian court in 1520). The Somali war exhausted Ethiopia, ending a period of cultural revival and exposing the empire to incursions by the Oromo. For the next two centuries the Ethiopian kingdom, centered at Gondar, was beset by ruinous civil wars among princes and again isolated from the outside world.[PARAGRAPH:2]The reunification of Ethiopia was begun in the 19th century by Tewodros II, who conquered Amhara, Gojjam, Tigray, and Shoa, and in 1855 had himself crowned emperor as Tewodros II. He began to modernize and centralize the legal and administrative systems. In 1867 tensions developed with Great Britain, and a British military expedition under Robert Napier was sent out. The emperor's forces were easily defeated near Magdala and to avoid capture, Tewodros committed suicide. A brief civil war followed, and in 1872 a chieftain of Tigray became emperor as Yohannes IV.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1889 a succession crisis ensued, eventually resulting in the king of Shoa crowned as emperor Menelik II. Italy invaded Ethiopia in 1895 but was decisively beaten by Menelik's forces at the battle of Adwa, March 1, 1896. Legend has it that Ethiopian nomadic mountain warriors of the Galla tribe since before 1000 A.D. would mix berries (coffee) with animal fat to give them energy before battles. These "Galla" warriors were noted for being among the most ferocious in Abyssinia, much like the ones that dealt the Italians their defeat.[PARAGRAPH:2]During his reign, Menelik greatly expanded the size of Ethiopia, adding the provinces of Harar, Sidamo, and Kaffa. After making Addis Ababa his capital in 1896, he began to modernize his military, government, developed the economy and built his country’s first railroad. Menelik died in 1913, he is widely acknowledged has one of history's greatest African Leaders.[PARAGRAPH:2]On Oct. 3, 1935, Italy invaded Ethiopia once more. The Italians quickly defeated the Ethiopians, Addis Ababa was  captured and Haile Selassie fled the country. In 1941, during World War II, Haile Selassie regained his throne with the help of British and South African Forces. In 1945, Ethiopia became a charter member of the United Nations.[PARAGRAPH:2]</English>

		<English>[H1]Emperor Menelik II[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of Ethiopia[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] 1844 - 1913[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]The son of Negus Haile Melekot of Shoa (1847 - 1855), prince Sahle Maryam was born in 1844 in Ankober, Shoa and as heir to the Shewan branch of the Solomonic Dynasty which claimed male-line descent from King Solomon of ancient Israel, and the Queen of Sheba. On the death of his father in 1855 he, just named as his successor as king of Shewa by his father, was taken prisoner by Emperor Tewodros II (Theodore II), a former minor noble originally named Kassa of Qwara, who had usurped the Imperial throne from the last Emperor of the elder Gondar branch of the Solomonic dynasty, Emperor Yohannis III (John III) or from emperor Sahle Dengel. Young Sahle Maryam of Shewa was imprisoned on Tewodros' mountain stronghold of Magdala, but was treated well by the Emperor, even marrying Tewodros's daughter Alitash. However, he eventually succeeded at escaping from Magdala and abandoned his wife, returning to Shewa to reclaim his ancestral crown and at once attacked the usurper claiming the Imperial throne for himself as well. These campaigns were unsuccessful, and he turned his arms to the west, east and south, and annexed much territory to his kingdom, still, however, maintaining his claims to the Imperial Crown of Ethiopia in addition to the royal one of Shewa.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1883, Negus Sahle Maryam married Taytu Betul, a noblewoman of Imperial blood, and a member of the leading families of the regions of Semien, Gojjam and Begemder. Her uncle Dejazmatch Wube Haile Maryam had been the ruler of Tigray and much of northern Ethiopia. She had been married four times previously and exercised considerable influence. Menelik and Taytu would have no children. Menelik had, previous to this marriage, sired not only Zauditu (eventually Empress of Ethiopia), but also another daughter, Shoaregga (who married Ras Mikael of Wollo), and a son Prince Wossen Seged who died in childhood. Menelek’s clemency to Ras Mangasha, whom he compelled to submit and then made hereditary Prince of his native Tigray, was ill repaid by a long series of revolts by that prince. Note: It is disputed -by other claimants- but likely that Menelek II's Tsehafi tezaz (prime minister) Gebreselassie was the Emperor's biological son outside of marriage. Although his inclusion/exclusion in the royal family tree remained controversial, he was given a very preferential treatment by the Emperor and was also made the prime minister of Abyssinia.[PARAGRAPH:2]After the suicide of Tewodros II in 1868 following his defeat at the hands of the British at Magdalla, Sahle Maryam continued to struggle against the various other claimants to the Imperial throne. The eventual successor, the Emperor Yohannis IV (better known to Europeans as King John of Abyssinia) was however able to better exert his claims due to the large number of weapons left to him by the British whom he had aided against Tewodros. Being again unsuccessful, Menelek resolved to await a more propitious occasion; so, acknowledging the supremacy of Yohannes. In 1886 Menelik married his daughter Zauditu to the Emperor’s son, the ras Araya Selassie. Ras Araya Selassie died in May 1888 without any issue by Zauditu of Shewa, and the Emperor Yohannis IV was killed in a war against the dervishes at the battle of Gallabat (Matemma) on May 10, 1889. The succession now lay between the late emperor’s natural son, the ras Mangasha, and Sahle Maryam of Shewa, but the latter was able to obtain the allegiance of a large majority of the nobility on November 4, and consecrated and crowned as Emperor Menelek II shortly afterwards. Menelek argued that while the family of Yohannis IV claimed descent from King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba through females of the dynasty, his own claim was based on uninterrupted direct male lineage which made the claims of the House of Shewa equal to those of the elder Gondar line of the dynasty.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1889, at the time when he was claiming the throne against Mangasha, Menelek signed at Wuchale in Wollo province (Uccialli in the Italian version), a treaty with Italy acknowledging the establishment of the new Italian Colony of Eritrea with its seat at Asmara. This colony had previously been part of the northern Tigrayan territories from which ras Mangasha had generated support, and the establishment of the Italian colony weakend the Ras. However, it was soon found that the Italian version of one of the articles of the treaty placed the Ethiopian Empire under Italian domination, while the Amharic version did not. Menelek denounced it, and after negotiations failed, abrogated it, leading Italy to declare war and invade from Eritrea. After defeating the Italians at Amba-Alagi and Mekele, he inflicted an even greater defeat on them, in the battle of Adowa on March 1, 1896, forcing them to capitulate. A treaty was signed recognizing the absolute independence of Ethiopia.</English>
		<French>[H1]Emperor Menelik II[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of Ethiopia[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] 1844 - 1913[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]The son of Negus Haile Melekot of Shoa (1847 - 1855), prince Sahle Maryam was born in 1844 in Ankober, Shoa and as heir to the Shewan branch of the Solomonic Dynasty which claimed male-line descent from King Solomon of ancient Israel, and the Queen of Sheba. On the death of his father in 1855 he, just named as his successor as king of Shewa by his father, was taken prisoner by Emperor Tewodros II (Theodore II), a former minor noble originally named Kassa of Qwara, who had usurped the Imperial throne from the last Emperor of the elder Gondar branch of the Solomonic dynasty, Emperor Yohannis III (John III) or from emperor Sahle Dengel. Young Sahle Maryam of Shewa was imprisoned on Tewodros' mountain stronghold of Magdala, but was treated well by the Emperor, even marrying Tewodros's daughter Alitash. However, he eventually succeeded at escaping from Magdala and abandoned his wife, returning to Shewa to reclaim his ancestral crown and at once attacked the usurper claiming the Imperial throne for himself as well. These campaigns were unsuccessful, and he turned his arms to the west, east and south, and annexed much territory to his kingdom, still, however, maintaining his claims to the Imperial Crown of Ethiopia in addition to the royal one of Shewa.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1883, Negus Sahle Maryam married Taytu Betul, a noblewoman of Imperial blood, and a member of the leading families of the regions of Semien, Gojjam and Begemder. Her uncle Dejazmatch Wube Haile Maryam had been the ruler of Tigray and much of northern Ethiopia. She had been married four times previously and exercised considerable influence. Menelik and Taytu would have no children. Menelik had, previous to this marriage, sired not only Zauditu (eventually Empress of Ethiopia), but also another daughter, Shoaregga (who married Ras Mikael of Wollo), and a son Prince Wossen Seged who died in childhood.

His father was Ras Makonnen Woldemikael Gudessa, the governor of Harar, and his mother was Weyziro (Lady) Yeshimebet Ali Abajifar. He inherited his imperial blood through his paternal grandmother, Princess Tenagnework Sahle Selassie, who was an aunt of Emperor Menelik II, and as such, claimed to be a direct descendant of Makeda, the queen of Sheba, and King Solomon of ancient Israel. Emperor Haile Selassie I had an elder half-brother, Dejazmach Yilma Makonnen, who preceded him as governor of Harar, but died not long after taking office.[PARAGRAPH:1]Well before Selassie's crowning as negus (king), he began work modernizing Ethiopia to rival that which he saw in Europe during his time abroad. He took steps to improve legislation, bureaucracy, government schooling, and health and social services in preparation for his new reign. More importantly in a diplomatic focus, Selassie acted to promote Ethiopian power and sovereignty and secure allies abroad. By 1923, working with the Empress Zauditu, the slave trade was abolished and Ethiopia was unanimously accepted into the League. He further acted to seek approval of other nations by emancipating existing slaves and their children and created government bureaus to do so. Also prior to his taking of power, Selassie promoted a twenty year treaty of friendship with Italy in 1928 and established legislation in 1930 to ban illegal sales of arms in Ethiopia, and to establish the government's right to procure arms for protection and internal unrest.[PARAGRAPH:1]Though the changes in Ethiopia sponsored by Selassie and his new progressive government seemed very promising, there lingered a new threat to the growing country when Benito Mussolini came to power in Italy in 1922. The north African colony of Eritrea, held by the Italians, was harmonious in its African/Italian co-existence from the 1890's until 1922, when Mussolini's administration began to emphasize the superiority of Italian inhabitants, and even enforced the segregation of the population. As late as 1928, motions of peace were made by Italy, but it seemed as though Mussolini wanted Eritrea only as a strategic base for future conquest in Africa. Selassie was forced to exile in 1936. On June 30, Haile Selassie went to Geneva to seek help from the League of Nations. He made a powerful speech in which he addressed the lack of enforcement of the Italian arms embargo, and quite effectively illustrated the consequences of the League's stifled actions. Selassie succeeded in raising the support of the United States and Russia, at least verbally, but Britain and France still recognized the Italian possession of Ethiopia by Italy.[PARAGRAPH:1]When Selassie returned to power, he realized the necessity of a dependable tax base and issued a flat tax based on the richness of the land. Unfortunately, the nobles of several provinces battled the tax and the path was lain for opposition to the newly re-established government. Selassie backed down from his new tax brackets and issued a flat tithe to all noble landowners who resisted, but this merely passed the tax on to the tenants of the regions, who carried the entire burden of taxation. Another huge reform made by Selassie was the 1948 change in the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. He removed the responsibility of appointment of the Church's patriarch from Alexandria to himself, a move which revolutionized the sixteen century old tradition.[PARAGRAPH:1]The years prior to 1974 were filled with rising inflation, corruption, and famine, as well as growing discontent by many of the organized urban groups and unions. Selassie had organized his military so that each branch opposed each other in class, benefits, or treatment in order to keep one from becoming so powerful as to threaten his power. In early June, a group known as the Derg (committee) who represented the military and worked behind closed doors to gain power militarily. Although they claimed allegiance to the emperor, they began arresting aristocracy and parliament members who were associated with the old order. This group effectively removed Selassie's means of governing, as they had complete military control. In July 1974, the Derg demanded a new constitution; when it was found to be unsatisfactory to their "Ethiopia First" ideology, they proceeded to undermine the emperor's authority, and enjoyed much public support. The emperor's estate and palace were nationalized and in August, Selassie was directly accused of covering up famine of the early 1970's which killed hundreds of thousands of people. On September 12th, he was formally deposed and arrested and power was given to the Derg, formally renamed the Provisional Military Administrative Council. In August 1975, His Imperial Majesty Haile Selassie died under questionable circumstances under house arrest, and was secretly buried.</English>
