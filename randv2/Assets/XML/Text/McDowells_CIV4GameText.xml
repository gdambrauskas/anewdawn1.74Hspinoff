		<English>Fast Food Restaurants are the lifeblood of these companies. Serving Burgers and Fries for lunch and Dinner and a Muffin Sandwich for breakfast for hungry customer, in foreign branches the same company not only makes Fast Food but also “Pub/Diner Food” available to the consumers there since smaller investments in foreign cities is risky and given the turnover rate of unsuccessful restaurants it will be a heavy risk to go in without major corporation backing. Hong Kong’s Fast Food branches for example have implemented several Hong Kong Cuisine Classics to their menu and some places like Germany allow beer to be served in their restaurants.[PARAGRAPH:1]Built under a “Bureaucratic” factory System, food produced here is cheap, fast and filling which has been so “effective” that it has a social effect termed as “McDonaldization” where Efficiency, Calculability, Predictability and Control is what society needs.
