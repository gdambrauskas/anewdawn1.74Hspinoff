		<English>[TAB]Himeji Castle is a flatland-mountain Japanese castle complex located in Himeji in Hyogo Prefecture and comprising 83 wooden buildings. It is occasionally known as Hakurojo or Shirasagijo ("White Heron Castle") because of its brilliant white exterior. It was registered as the first Japanese National Cultural Treasure by UNESCO World Heritage Site and a Japanese National Cultural Treasure in December, 1993. Along with Matsumoto Castle and Kumamoto Castle, it is one of Japan's "Three Famous Castles", and is the most visited castle in Japan.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]Himeji serves as an excellent example of the prototypical Japanese castle, containing many of the defensive and architectural features most associated with Japanese castles. The tall stone foundations, whitewash walls, and organization of the buildings within the complex are standard elements of any Japanese castle, and the site also features many other examples of typical castle design, including gun emplacements and stone-dropping holes.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]One of Himeji's most important defensive elements, and perhaps its most famous, is the confusing maze of paths leading to the main keep. The gates, baileys, and outer walls of the complex are organized so as to cause an approaching force to travel in a spiral pattern around the castle on their way into the keep, facing many dead ends. This allowed the intruders to be watched and fired upon from the keep during their entire approach. However, Himeji was never attacked in this manner, and so the system remains untested.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]The castle was conceived and constructed during the Nanboku-cho era of the Muromachi period. At this time, it was called Himeyama Castle. In 1331, Akamatsu Sadanori planned a castle at the base of Mount Himeji, where Akamatsu Norimura had constructed the temple of Shomyoji. After Akamatsu fell during the Kakitsu War, Yamana clan briefly took over planning of the castle; the Akamatsu family took over again following the Onin War.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]Himeji was one of the last holdouts of the tozama daimyo at the end of the Edo period. It was held by the descendants of Sakai Tadasumi until the Meiji Restoration. In 1868, the new Japanese government sent the Okayama army, under the command of a descendant of Ikeda Terumasa, to shell the castle with blank cartridges and drive its occupiers out.</English>

		<German>[TAB]Die Burg von Himeji ist ein Komplex aus 83 h&#246;lzernen Geb&#228;uden im H&#252;gelland der Hyogo-Pr&#228;fektur. Gelegentlich wird sie auch als Hakurojo oder Shirasagijo ("Wei&#223;e Fischreiher-Burg") wegen ihrer strahlend wei&#223;en Au&#223;enseite bezeichnet. Sie wurde im Dezember 1993 als erster nationaler japanischer Kulturschatz im Weltkulturerbe der UNESCO aufgenommen. Zusammen mit der Matsumoto- und der Kumamoto-Burg bildet sie die japanischen "3 ber&#252;hmten Burgen" und ist die meistbesuchte Burg von ganz Japan.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]Himeji ist ein typischer Repr&#228;sentant einer japanischen Burg, da sie die meisten typischen Verteidigungseinrichtungen und architektonischen Details besitzt. Die gewaltigen Steinfundamente, die wei&#223; verputzen Mauern und die Aufteilung der Geb&#228;ude im Komplex sind Standardelemente aller japanischer Burgen. Weitere typische Elemente sind die Anordnung der Kanonen und der &#214;ffnungen um Steine herabzuwerfen.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]Eine der wichtigsten und vielleicht ber&#252;hmtesten der Verteidigungeinrichtungen von Himeji ist das verwirrende Wegelabyrinth das zum Hauptturm f&#252;hrt. Die Tore, H&#246;fe und Au&#223;enmauern des Komplexes sind so angeordnet, dass Angreifer sich auf dem Weg zum Hauptturm spiralartig um die Burg bewegen m&#252;ssen und dabei immer wieder in Sackgassen geraten. Dabei konnten die Eindringlinge w&#228;hrend ihrer Ann&#228;herung vom Turm aus beobachtet und beschossen werden. Allerdings wurde Himeji nie auf diese Weise angegriffen und damit das System niemals ausprobiert.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]Geplant und gebaut wurde die Burg in der Nanboku-cho &#196;ra der Muromachi-Periode. Damals wurde sie noch Himeyama-Burg genannt. 1331 plante Akamatsu Sadanori eine Burg am Fu&#223; des Himeji-Berges, wo zuvor Akamatsu Norimura den Shomyoji-Tempel gebaut hatte. Nachdem Akamatsu im Kakitsu-Krieg fiel &#252;bernahm f&#252;r eine kurze Zeit der Yamana-Klan die Planung der Burg; nach dem Onin-Krieg war aber wieder die Akamatsu-Familie zust&#228;ndig.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]Himeji war einer der letzten St&#252;tzpunkte der Tozama Daimyo zum Ende der Edo-Periode. Bis zur Meiji-Restauration wurde sie von den Erben von Sakai Tadasumi gehalten. 1868 sandte die neue japanische Regierung die Okayama-Armee unter dem Kommando eines Nachkommen von Ikeda Terumasa, um die Burg mit Platzpatronen zu beschie&#223;en und ihre Besitzer zu vertreiben.</German>
