		<English>The BBM, or Biological Ballistic Missile, is the next step up from the Biological Missile. This missile can be considered a nuke by it's devastating effects that it unleashes upon impact. Using genetic manipulation, the artificial viruses contained within make beings sick beyond anything they have ever experienced before all while the synthetic smog protects the viruses from the sun and also contains Hydrochloric Acid vapors to eat away at metal simultaneously. If the viral entities enter water, it will become polluted, killing all sea life and plugging up all natural vents such as oil deposites. WARNING: Viral clouds are subject to wind and may spread to other plots and may cause entire continents to be consumed if not taken care of.</English>

Using the latest in Genetic manipulation, these new viruses not only make people sick, killing them at an extremely accelerated rate, but can spread like a wild fire. The new and improved smog also contains concentrated Sulfuric Acid vapors to easily take down anything from a tank to a battleship.

		<English>This weapon has two uses. To make waterways or to wage war. If used even on your own land, it may have diplomatic consequences. The Tactical Fusi is a small yet devastating bomb. It's implosion radius is just the square it was landed on, however, due to the effects that fusion provides, everything (even the plot) will be converted to water. Say there was a stack of any fifty units on a city of seventy population points sitting on top of an Oil resource. After this weapon is used, all fifty units are destroyed, the city has been wiped off the face of the planet, the Oil has been vaporized, the land has been fused into a ball the size of a baseball, and all thats left is the underlying water table that all the continents sit on. WARNING: AI use this bomb for nuking purposes only, and it is possible to eradicate your own units or cities.</English>

		<English>The Tactical Fusi (short for Fusion) is the first in the latest and greatest way to give that special civilization a good surprise. This new type of bomb obsoletes the need for messy explosions including the all-elusive radiation fallout from nuclear bombs. Instead, this bomb expands upon the power of implosions, forcing everything within it's radius into a ball of mush the size of a baseball. Due to the pure intensity of this weapon, only so many may be made to try and keep the pothole count down. This is also a great weapon to make a canal or give that useless, landlocked city some water access. WARNING: try to keep as many civs allied at a time so your country won't end up as a big lake.</English>
