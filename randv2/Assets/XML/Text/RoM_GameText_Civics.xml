		<English>A chiefdom is a type of complex society of varying degrees of centralization that is led by an individual known as a chief. [PARAGRAPH:2]In anthropological theory, one model of human social development rooted in ideas of cultural evolution describes a chiefdom as a form of social organization more complex than a tribe or a band society, and less complex than a state or a civilization. The most succinct definition of a chiefdom in anthropology belongs to Robert L. Carneiro: "An autonomous political unit comprising a number of villages or communities under the permanent control of a paramount chief" (Carneiro 1981: 45).[PARAGRAPH:2]Chiefdoms are characterized by pervasive inequality and centralization of authority. At least two inherited social classes (elite and commoner) are present (Ancient Hawaiian chiefdoms had as many as four social classes), although an individual might change social class during a lifetime by extraordinary behavior. A single lineage/family of the elite class becomes the ruling elite of the chiefdom, with the greatest influence, power, and prestige. Kinship is typically an organizing principle, while marriage, age, and gender can affect one's social status and role.[PARAGRAPH:2]A single simple chiefdom is generally composed of a central community surrounded by or near a number of smaller subsidiary communities. All of these communities recognize the authority of a single kin group or individual with hereditary centralized power, dwelling in the primary community. Each community will have its own leaders, which are usually in a tributary and/or subservient relationship with the ruling elite of the primary community.</English>
		<French>Un domaine de chefs de tribus est un type de société complexe avec différents degrés de centratlisation, mené par un leader : le chef de tribut. [PARAGRAPH:2]Dans les théories  anthropologiques, un modèle du développement social des êtreshumains a pris racine dans les idées de l'évolution culturelle écrit un domaine de chefs comme un forme d'organisation sociale plus complexe qu'une tribu ou une bande, et moins complexe qu'un état ou une civilization. La définition la plus succinte en antropologie est celle de Robert L. Carneiro: "Une entité polotiquement autonome comprenant un nombre de villages ou des communautés sous le contrôle permanant d'un Chef" (Carneiro 1981: 45).[PARAGRAPH:2]Les domaines de chefs sont caractérisés par une grande inégalité et la centralisation de l'autorité. Un moins deux classes sociales y sont associées (l'élite et la base - les ancients domaines Hawaiiens avait au moins quatre classes sociales), et un individu pouvait changer de classe sociale au cours de sa vie en accomplissant un exploit par exemple. Une seule lignée/famille de la classe d'élite devient dirigeantedu domaine,avec la plus grande influence, le pouvoir et le prestige.</French>

		<English>A monarchy is a form of government in which supreme power is absolutely or nominally lodged with an individual, who is the head of state, often for life or until abdication, and "is wholly set apart from all other members of the state." The person who heads a monarchy is called a monarch. It was a common form of government in the world during ancient and medieval times.[PARAGRAPH:2]There is no clear definition of monarchy. Holding unlimited political power in the state is not the defining characteristic, as many constitutional monarchies such as the United Kingdom and Thailand are considered monarchies.[PARAGRAPH:2]Hereditary rule is often a common characteristic, but elective monarchies are also considered monarchies (the pope, sovereign of the Vatican City State, is elected by the College of Cardinals) and some states have hereditary rulers, but are considered republics (such as the stadtholder of the Dutch Republic, or the Great Council of Chiefs in Fiji).</English>

Cette forme de gouvernement était très répandue dans le monde dans l'antiquité et jusqu'au Moyen-Age.[PARAGRAPH:2]Il n'y a pas de définition claire d'une monarchie.

		<English>A republic is a form of government in which the citizens choose their leaders and the people (or at least a part of its people) have an impact on its government. The word "republic" is derived from the Latin phrase res publica, which can be translated as "a public affair". [PARAGRAPH:2]Both modern and ancient republics vary widely in their ideology and composition. The most common definition of a republic is a state without a monarch. In republics such as the United States and France the executive is legitimated both by a constitution and by popular suffrage. In the United States, James Madison defined republic in terms of representative democracy as opposed to direct democracy , and this usage is still employed by many viewing themselves as "republicans". In modern political science, republicanism refers to a specific ideology that is based on civic virtue and is considered distinct from ideologies such as liberalism. [PARAGRAPH:2]Most often a republic is a sovereign country, but there are also subnational entities that are referred to as republics, or which have governments that are described as "republican" in nature. For instance, Article IV of the Constitution of the United States "guarantee[s] to every State in this Union a Republican form of Government." The Soviet Union was a single nation composed of distinct and legally sovereign Soviet Socialist Republics.</English>

Fascists identify violence and war as actions that create national regeneration, spirit and vitality.

		<English>Communism is a social structure in which classes are abolished and property is commonly controlled, as well as a political philosophy and social movement that advocates and aims to create such a society. Karl Marx, the father of communist thought, posited that communism would be the final stage in society, which would be achieved through a proletarian revolution and only possible after a socialist stage develops the productive forces, leading to a superabundance of goods and services. [PARAGRAPH:2]"Pure communism" in the Marxian sense refers to a classless, stateless and oppression-free society where decisions on what to produce and what policies to pursue are made democratically, allowing every member of society to participate in the decision-making process in both the political and economic spheres of life. In modern usage, communism is often used to refer to the policies of the various communist states which were authoritarian governments that had ownership of all the means of production and centrally planned economies. Most communist governments based their ideology on Marxism-Leninism.</English>

		<English>Democracy is a political government either carried out directly by the people (direct democracy) or by means of elected representatives of the people (Representative democracy). Even though there is no specific, universally accepted definition of 'democracy', there are two principles that any definition of democracy includes, equality and freedom. These principles are reflected by all citizens being equal before the law, and having equal access to power, and freedom is secured by legitimized rights and liberties, which are generally protected by a constitution. [PARAGRAPH:2]There are several varieties of democracy, some of which provide better representation and more freedoms for their citizens than others. However, if any democracy is not carefully legislated to avoid an uneven distribution of political power with balances, such as the separation of powers, then a branch of the system of rule could accumulate power and become harmful to the democracy itself.</English>

		<English>Nobility is a state-privileged status which is generally hereditary. Titles of nobility are usually associated with present or former monarchies. The term originally referred to those who were "known" or "notable" and was applied to the highest social class in pre-modern societies. In the feudal system (in Europe and elsewhere), the nobility were generally those who held a fief, often land or office, under vassalage, i.e., in exchange for allegiance and various, mainly military, services to the Monarch and at lower levels to another nobleman. It rapidly came to be seen as a hereditary caste, sometimes associated with a right to bear a hereditary title and, for example in pre-revolutionary France, enjoying fiscal and other privileges. While noble status formerly conferred significant privileges, today, in most Western countries, noble status is a purely honorary dignity. In the United Kingdom, where some peerage titles, until recently, guaranteed a seat in the Upper House of the Parliament, there are still some residual privileges. [PARAGRAPH:2]Nobility is a historical, social and often legal notion, distinct from socio-economic status which is mainly based on income and possessions. Being wealthy or influential does not automatically make one a noble, nor are all nobles wealthy and influential (aristocratic families have lost their fortunes in various ways, and the concept of the 'poor nobleman' is almost as old as nobility itself). Countries without a feudal tradition do not have a nobility as such. [PARAGRAPH:2]European nobility originated from the feudal/seignorial system that arose in Europe during the Middle Ages. Originally, knights or nobles were mounted warriors who swore allegiance to their sovereign and promised to fight for him in exchange for an allocation of land (usually together with serfs living there). During the time period known as the Military Revolution, nobles gradually lost their role of raising and commanding private armies, as many nations created cohesive national armies. This was coupled with a loss of the social-economic power of the nobility, owing to the economic changes of the Renaissance and the growing economic importance of the merchant classes (or bourgeoisie), which increased still further during the Industrial Revolution. In countries where the nobility was the dominant class, the bourgeoisie gradually grew in power; a rich city merchant was more influential than a minor rural nobleman. However, in many countries at this time, the nobility retained great social and political importance; for instance, the UK's government was dominated by the nobility until the middle of the 19th century and thereafter the powers of the nobility were progressively reduced by legislation (see Reform of the House of Lords).</English>

		<English>The term patrician originally referred to a group of elite citizens in ancient Rome, including both their natural and adopted members. In the late Roman Empire, the class was broadened to include high council officials, and after the fall of the Western Empire it remained a high honorary title in the Byzantine Empire. Medieval patrician classes were once again formally defined groups of elite burgher families in many medieval Italian republics, such as Venice and Genoa, and subsequently "patrician" became a vaguer term used for aristocrats and elite bourgeoisie in many countries.

		<English>A senate is a deliberative assembly, often the upper house or chamber of a legislature or parliament. There have been many such bodies in history, since senate means the assembly of the eldest and wiser members of the society and ruling class. Two of the first official senates were the Spartan Gerousia and the Roman Senate. [PARAGRAPH:2]The members or legislators of a senate are called senators. The Latin word senator was adopted into English with no change in spelling. Its meaning is derived from a very ancient form of simple social organization in which decision-making powers are reserved for the eldest men. For the same reason, the word senate is correctly used when referring to any powerful authority characteristically composed by the eldest members of a community, as a deliberative body of a faculty in an institution of higher learning is often called a senate. The original senate was the Roman Senate, which lasted until 580 (various efforts to revive it were made in Medieval Rome). In the Eastern Roman Empire, the Byzantine Senate continued until the Fourth Crusade. [PARAGRAPH:2]Modern democratic states with bicameral parliamentary systems are sometimes equipped with a senate, often distinguished from an ordinary parallel lower house, known variously as the "House of Representatives", "House of Commons", "Chamber of Deputies", "National Assembly", "Legislative Assembly", or "House of Assembly", by electoral rules. This may include minimum age required for voters and candidates, proportional or majoritarian or plurality system, and an electoral basis or collegium. Typically, the senate is referred to as the upper house and has a smaller membership than the lower house. In some federal states senates also exist at the subnational level. In the United States all states other than Nebraska have a state senate. In Australia all states other than Queensland have an upper house known as a legislative council. Several Canadian provinces also once had legislative councils, but these have all been abolished, the last being Quebec's Legislative Council, in 1968. [PARAGRAPH:2]Senate membership can be determined either through elections or appointments. For example, elections are held every three years for half the membership of the Australian Senate, the term of a senator being six years. In contrast, members of the Canadian Senate are appointed by the Governor General upon the recommendation of the Prime Minister of Canada, holding the office until they resign, are removed, or retire at the mandatory age of 75. In larger countries, the senate often serves a balancing effect by giving a larger share of power to regions or groups which would otherwise be overwhelmed under strictly popular apportionment.</English>

		<English>A parliament is a legislature, especially in those countries whose system of government is based on the Westminster system modeled after that of the United Kingdom. The name is derived from the French parlement, the action of parler (to speak): a parlement is a discussion. The term came to mean a meeting at which such a discussion took place. It acquired its modern meaning as it came to be used for the body of people (in an institutional sense) who would meet to discuss matters of state. [PARAGRAPH:2]The origins of the modern concept of prime ministerial government go back to the Kingdom of Great Britain (1707 - 1800) and The Parliamentary System in Sweden 1721 - 1772 , that coincided with each other. [PARAGRAPH:2]In theory, power resided in the monarch, who chaired cabinet and chose ministers. In reality, King George I's inability to speak English led the responsibility for chairing cabinet to go to the leading minister, literally the prime or first minister. The gradual democratisation of parliament with the broadening of the voting franchise increased parliament's role in controlling government, and in deciding who the king could ask to form a government. By the nineteenth century, the Great Reform Act of 1832 led to parliamentary dominance, with its choice invariably deciding who was prime minister and the complexion of the government.[PARAGRAPH:2]Other countries gradually adopted what came to be called the Westminster Model of government, with an executive answerable to parliament, but exercising powers nominally vested in the head of state, in the name of the head of state. Hence the use of phrases like Her Majesty's government or His Excellency's government. Such a system became particularly prevalent in older British dominions, many of whom had their constitutions enacted by the British parliament. Examples include Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the Irish Free State and the Union of South Africa, though these parliaments themselves have often evolved or were reformed from their British model: the Australian Senate, for instance, more closely reflects the US Senate than the British House of Lords; whereas there is no upper house in New Zealand.[PARAGRAPH:2]In very ancient India, during the Vedic civilization, there are mentions of two Parliament-like gatherings of the Indo-Aryan kingdoms called the Sabha and the Samiti. During the time of the Buddha, many states were even tribal republics, called the Sanghas. The Sabha has been interpreted by the historians as a representative assembly of the elect-the important men of the clan, which ran day-to-day business with the king. The Samiti seems to be a gathering of all the male members of the kingdom, and probably convened only for the ratification/election of a new king. The two largely democratic institutions, which kept a check on the absolutism of the king, were given a sacred position, and have been called the daughters of the deity Prajapati in the Vedas, the holiest of all Hindu scriptures and the earliest Indo-European literature. However, these democratic institutions became weaker as republics became larger and elected chieftainship moved towards hereditary and absolute monarchy. The Sabha and the Samiti bear almost no mention in later literature.

The name is derived from the French parlement, the action of parler (to speak): a parlement is a discussion. The term came to mean a meeting at which such a discussion took place. It acquired its modern meaning as it came to be used for the body of people (in an institutional sense) who would meet to discuss matters of state. [PARAGRAPH:2]The origins of the modern concept of prime ministerial government go back to the Kingdom of Great Britain (1707 - 1800) and The Parliamentary System in Sweden 1721 - 1772 , that coincided with each other. [PARAGRAPH:2]In theory, power resided in the monarch, who chaired cabinet and chose ministers. In reality, King George I's inability to speak English led the responsibility for chairing cabinet to go to the leading minister, literally the prime or first minister. The gradual democratisation of parliament with the broadening of the voting franchise increased parliament's role in controlling government, and in deciding who the king could ask to form a government. By the nineteenth century, the Great Reform Act of 1832 led to parliamentary dominance, with its choice invariably deciding who was prime minister and the complexion of the government.[PARAGRAPH:2]Other countries gradually adopted what came to be called the Westminster Model of government, with an executive answerable to parliament, but exercising powers nominally vested in the head of state, in the name of the head of state. Hence the use of phrases like Her Majesty's government or His Excellency's government. Such a system became particularly prevalent in older British dominions, many of whom had their constitutions enacted by the British parliament. Examples include Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the Irish Free State and the Union of South Africa, though these parliaments themselves have often evolved or were reformed from their British model: the Australian Senate, for instance, more closely reflects the US Senate than the British House of Lords; whereas there is no upper house in New Zealand.[PARAGRAPH:2]In very ancient India, during the Vedic civilization, there are mentions of two Parliament-like gatherings of the Indo-Aryan kingdoms called the Sabha and the Samiti. During the time of the Buddha, many states were even tribal republics, called the Sanghas. The Sabha has been interpreted by the historians as a representative assembly of the elect-the important men of the clan, which ran day-to-day business with the king. The Samiti seems to be a gathering of all the male members of the kingdom, and probably convened only for the ratification/election of a new king. The two largely democratic institutions, which kept a check on the absolutism of the king, were given a sacred position, and have been called the daughters of the deity Prajapati in the Vedas, the holiest of all Hindu scriptures and the earliest Indo-European literature. However, these democratic institutions became weaker as republics became larger and elected chieftainship moved towards hereditary and absolute monarchy. The Sabha and the Samiti bear almost no mention in later literature. After this, India would not have any democratic legislature till the British times, culminating in its modern democratic Parliament (whose two Houses still bear the name of Sabha).</French>

		<English>President is a title held by many leaders of organizations, companies, trade unions, universities, and countries. Etymologically, a "president" is one who presides, who sits in leadership. Originally, the term referred to the presiding officer of a ceremony or meeting (i.e., chairman), but today it most commonly refers to an official. Among other things, president today is a common title for the heads of state of most republics, whether popularly elected, chosen by the legislature or by a special electoral college. It is also often adopted by dictators. [PARAGRAPH:2]As an English word, the term was originally used to refer to the presiding officer of a committee or governing body in Great Britain. Early examples are the President of the Exchequer ("presidentis" in the original Latin, from the Dialogue concerning the Exchequer, 1179), the presidents of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge (from 1464), and the founding President of the Royal Society (William Brouncker, 1660). [PARAGRAPH:2]Later this usage was applied to political leaders, including the leaders of some of the Thirteen Colonies (originally Virginia in 1608); in full, the "President of the Council". The first president of a country was George Washington, the President of the United States. In America the title was "upgraded" from its earlier use for the President of the Continental Congress, the "officer in charge of the Continental Congress" since 1774. As other countries deposed their monarchies and became republics, president was commonly adopted as the title for the head of state. The first European president was the president of France, a post created in the Second Republic of 1848. The first president of an internationally recognized African state was the President of Liberia in 1848. Today, most republics have a President as their head of state.[PARAGRAPH:2]In states with a presidential system of government, the president exercises the functions of Head of State and Head of Government, i.e. he or she directs the executive branch of government.</English>

		<English>Feudal in most instances represents the social structure used during the Medieval period. It consists of peasants bound by contract as serfs to lords.

		<English>Mercantile represents an economy using the mercantile system. The mercantile system believes that the volume of the world economy is constant and the prosperity of a nation is equivalent to the amount capital owned by that country. Capital is represented by gold and silver bullion owned by the government, and the government actively attempts to make the exports higher than imports in order to create a net gain of capital. The government does this by increasing tariffs, or taxes on imports. Civilizations not using the mercantile system tend to choose not to trade with mercantilist nations due to the high tariffs, so trade is restricted to domestic trade and foreign trade with other mercantilist nations where the tariffs balance out. Some scholars consider it to be an early form of capitalism while others consider it to be an entirely different economic theory.</English>

		<German>Mercantile represents an economy using the mercantile system. The mercantile system believes that the volume of the world economy is constant and the prosperity of a nation is equivalent to the amount capital owned by that country. Capital is represented by gold and silver bullion owned by the government, and the government actively attempts to make the exports higher than imports in order to create a net gain of capital. The government does this by increasing tariffs, or taxes on imports.

		<English>Laissez-Faire is a French term meaning "let do." Laissez-Faire represents many types of capitalism, including the Chicago School, the Austrian School, monetarism, and supply-side economics, all of which believe the government should not intervene in the economy through regulations. Until the formation of the Federal Reserve System, laissez-faire economists were against the idea of a Central Bank. Due to lack of regulations, workers prefer having higher wages than better working environments, thus decreasing their health. Time periods using laissez-faire economics are characterized as having a massive boost in production and increased foreign and domestic trade.</English>

		<English>Corporatist represents an economic policy that is geared toward giving the highest possible profits and highest possible growth to domestic corporations at the expense of consumers and workers. Corporatism can be caused either by corporate executives running the government or from bribes by corporate lobbyists. Corporatism leads to a large amount of wealth accumulated by the government and a much lower cost of maintaining corporations, but it severely angers the bulk of society: the working class, so it should only be used if you are sure you can satisfy the people with buildings and resources. As of now, no country has employed a corporatist economy.</English>

Keynes advocated a mixed economy where the government intervenes in the economy in order to increase demand and stimulate the economy. The expensive regulations and bureaucracy used to maintain the interventionist policies come from taxation with a bulk of the taxes coming from corporations. Keynesian economists believe in smoothing the business cycle, which causes booms and busts, by raising taxes and interest rates to cool the economy and lowering taxes and interest rates to stimulate it. The result is a relatively stable economy void of depressions and panics, but also of giant boom periods.

Similarly to Free Church, the church is powerful and has influence on the civilization. However, commerce and trade increases in the capital city rather than the holy city due to the states centralization of religion.</English>

		<English>Intolerant represents a society that is extremely intolerant of all non-state religions and scientific research that could undermine their religion. An intolerant society, with the help of the church and/or the state, eradicates all non-state religions in your civilization through an inquisition. In addition, all soldiers are conditioned to fight to the death for their religion and are guaranteed a good afterlife if they do so. Intolerant is great for creating a massive religious military campaign, known as a crusade or holy war, but completely undermines all scientific and technological advancement. Examples of intolerance are Europe during the Crusades, the Spanish Inquisition, and modern Islamic Jihadists.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Despotism is a form of government characterized by a ruler who wields absolute power over his people. Despite the word's negative connotations, a leader doesn't necessarily have to be a corrupt, evil megalomaniac to be a despot; it is possible to be a benevolent despot, though history records few cases of such. [PARAGRAPH:2]The strength of this form of government is that the ruler can easily implement his decisions; he does not need to compromise, cajole, or bribe anyone to get the job done. The weakness of this form of government is that the ruler can implement bad decisions just as easily as good ones; with no checks and balances, how can he be stopped? Also, there is a lot of truth in the old saying, "Power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely." And though as said before, despots don't need to be corrupt, evil megalomaniacs, many of them end up that way.</English>
		<French>[TAB]Le despotisme est une forme de gouvernement au sein duquel le dirigeant d&#233;tient le pouvoir absolu sur son peuple. Contrairement &#224; ce que l'on pense, un despote n'est pas forc&#233;ment un m&#233;galomane corrompu et mauvais. Le monde a connu des despotes bienveillants, m&#234;me s'il y en a eu peu. [PARAGRAPH:2]La force de ce type de gouvernement r&#233;side dans le fait que le dirigeant peut imposer facilement ses d&#233;cisions, sans passer par des compromis, des cajoleries ou des pots de vins. La faiblesse de ces r&#233;gimes r&#233;side dans le fait que le dirigeant peut aussi facilement imposer ses mauvaises d&#233;cisions puisqu'il n'y a pas de contre-pouvoirs. De plus, il y a une certaine v&#233;rit&#233; dans l'expression : "le pouvoir corrompt, le pouvoir absolu corrompt absolument." Et m&#234;me si les despotes ne sont pas n&#233;cessairement corrompus, beaucoup d'entre eux finissent par le devenir t&#244;t ou tard.</French>
		<German>[TAB]Der Despotismus ist eine Willk&#252;rherrschaft, bei der ein Herrscher absolute Macht &#252;ber sein Volk aus&#252;bt. Trotz der eher negativen Belegung des Wortes ist dieser Herrscher allerdings nicht zwingend korrupt, b&#246;se und gr&#246;&#223;enwahnsinnig. Es hat im Laufe der Menschheitsgeschichte durchaus (wenn auch nur wenige) g&#252;tige Despoten gegeben. [PARAGRAPH:2]Der Vorteil dieser Regierungsform ist die einfache Umsetzbarkeit der Vorstellungen des Herrschers. Dieser muss keine Kompromisse eingehen und mit niemandem verhandeln, um seinen Willen durchzusetzen. Allerdings gilt dies f&#252;r segensreiche UND schlechte Entscheidungen, da diese von keiner gleichberechtigten oder &#252;bergeordneten Instanz in Frage gestellt werden. Daher ist das alte Sprichwort: "Macht korrumpiert, absolute Macht korrumpiert absolut" leider in aller Regel zutreffend. Fr&#252;her oder sp&#228;ter verliert auch der g&#252;tigste Despot seinen Sinn f&#252;r die Realit&#228;t.</German>

No necesita convencer, seducir o sobornar a nadie para conseguirlo. Su debilidad estriba en que las malas decisiones son igualmente f&#225;ciles de impulsar. Sin equilibrios ni contrapoderes, nadie puede detener al d&#233;spota. Adem&#225;s, hay mucha verdad en el antiguo dicho que asegura, "el poder corrompe, y el poder absoluto corrompe absolutamente".

		<English>[TAB]Hereditary Rule is a form of government wherein the rulership is passed down from one member of the family to the next. This kind of succession is most often associated with monarchical rulers, but it occasionally appears in despotisms or even purportedly communist regimes - North Korea, for example. There is often a religious justification for hereditary rule; kings are said to rule by "divine right" or "the mandate of Heaven." [PARAGRAPH:2]The strength of hereditary rule is that there is usually a clear line of succession, and thus perhaps less squabbling for power when the current monarch dies. (There are plenty of exceptions to this rule throughout history, of course.) Further, there may be a certain amount of familial pressure on the ruler to not mess things up too badly for the next generation. However, hereditary rule suffers the same kind of weaknesses as do all unelected rulers; the leader is not answerable to the people, and it can be extremely difficult to get rid of a bad one.</English>
		<French>[TAB]Le droit h&#233;r&#233;ditaire est une forme de gouvernement par lequel le pouvoir est transmis d'un membre de la famille r&#233;gnante &#224; un autre.

Le droit h&#233;r&#233;ditaire est souvent justifi&#233; par la religion. Les rois sont ainsi de "droit divin" ou "mandat&#233; par le ciel". [PARAGRAPH:2]La force du droit h&#233;r&#233;ditaire r&#233;side dans une relative tranquillit&#233; lors des successions, l'h&#233;ritier &#233;tant connu d'avance. L'histoire, cependant, est riche d'exceptions &#224; cette r&#232;gle. De plus, la personne r&#233;gnante est plus ou moins surveill&#233;e par sa famille, qui ne tient pas &#224; ce qu'il laisse &#224; ses successeurs une situation chaotique. Cependant, le droit h&#233;r&#233;ditaire souffre des faiblesses propres aux r&#233;gimes dans lesquels le dirigeant n'est pas &#233;lu. Le dirigeant n'a pas &#224; r&#233;pondre devant le peuple, et aussi mauvais qu'il puisse &#234;tre, il est tr&#232;s difficile de s'en d&#233;barrasser.</French>
		<German>[TAB]Das Erbrecht ist eine Regierungsform, bei der die Regentschaft von einem Familienmitglied an das n&#228;chste weitergegeben wird. Diese Art der Nachfolge wird h&#228;ufig in Monarchien praktiziert. Gelegentlich wird aber auch im Despotismus oder Kommunismus (Nordkorea) darauf zur&#252;ckgegriffen. Das Erbrecht st&#252;tzt sich nicht selten auf eine religi&#246;se Rechtfertigung in Form eines "Gottesgnadentums" des Monarchen. [PARAGRAPH:2]Der Vorteil des Erbrechts ist die im Regelfall klar geregelte Erbfolge. Dadurch halten sich Streitigkeiten nach dem Tod des Monarchen meist in Grenzen. Dar&#252;ber hinaus kann die Familie betr&#228;chtlichen Druck auf den Herrscher aus&#252;ben. Allerdings ist ein nach dem Erbrecht eingesetzter Herrscher seinem Volk keinerlei Rechenschaft schuldig und es ist relativ schwierig, einen ungeliebten Regenten abzusetzen.</German>

		<English>[TAB]Under a police state the government maintains strict control over its populace by means of a police force (and often a "secret" police force). Civil liberties are denied and those who voice opinions contrary to the government are subject to punishments ranging from imprisonment to death. [PARAGRAPH:2]The strength of police states lies in their ability to control the population in bad times, forcing them to do what's necessary no matter what their personal opinions of the matter may be. It has been argued, for example, that Stalin's Soviet Union would not have survived the German assault in World War II if he didn't have the entire power of the state under his dictatorial control. The weakness of the police state comes from its tendency to crush individual initiative and inventiveness. Police states are often subject to excesses of paranoia; they see everyone as against them and constantly implement more repressive policies to remain in power.</English>

The contract is often of both political and religious significance binding both parties by the rules of man and of God. [PARAGRAPH:2]Vassalage is often tribal in nature. One tribe conquers another, and rather than killing the conquered tribe or taking over its direct management, the conquering ruler makes the conquered his vassal: the lower ruler continues to maintain control over his people and territory, while paying tribute to his or her lord in the form of money, goods, soldiers or slaves. </English>
		<French>[TAB]La vassalit&#233; est un terme f&#233;odal qui fait r&#233;f&#233;rence aux engagements pris entre des personnes et leur seigneur, l'un promettant de servir et de prot&#233;ger l'autre contre de l'argent, des biens ou m&#234;me la souverainet&#233; sur une parcelle de terres. Ce type de contrat a souvent &#224; la fois une signification politique et religieuse, les deux parties &#233;tant li&#233;es devant les hommes et devant Dieu. [PARAGRAPH:2]La vassalit&#233; est souvent tribale par nature. Une tribu en envahit une autre, mais plut&#244;t que de tuer tout le monde ou de s'emparer des r&#234;nes du pouvoir, le conqu&#233;rant fait du vaincu son vassal : ce dernier continue d'exercer le pouvoir sur son peuple, mais verse un tribut &#224; son seigneur sous la forme d'argent, de biens, de soldats ou d'esclaves. </French>
		<German>[TAB]Vasallen waren in der feudalen Gesellschaft Personen, die ihren Lehnsherren dienten oder diese besch&#252;tzten und f&#252;r ihre Dienste mit Geld, Grundbesitz oder Macht belohnt wurden. Der Vertrag zwischen Lehnsherr und Vasall hatte nicht selten eine politische oder religi&#246;se Bedeutung und war f&#252;r beide Parteien bindend.[PARAGRAPH:2]Das Vasallentum ist vor allem f&#252;r Stammeskulturen typisch. Erobert Stamm A beispielsweise Stamm B, wird Letzterer automatisch ein Vasall des Siegers. Der unterlegene Herrscher bleibt in diesem Fall im Amt und verpflichtet sich, seinen Bezwinger mit Geld, Waren, Soldaten oder Sklaven zu unterst&#252;tzen.</German>

Il contratto assume spesso un significato politico e religioso, legando entrambe le parti alle leggi umane e divine. [PARAGRAPH:2]Il vassallaggio assume spesso connotazioni di natura tribale. Una trib&#249; conquista un'altra e, invece di sterminarla o prendere il possesso della loro gestione, il vincitore della battaglia trasforma il perdente in un vassallo: il soggiogato continua a mantenere il controllo sulla propria gente e sul territorio, pagando per&#242; dei tributi sotto forma di soldi, beni, soldati o schiavi al proprio signore.</Italian>

Normalmente, el contrato tiene connotaciones pol&#237;ticas y religiosas y somete a ambas partes a las leyes del hombre y de Dios.  [PARAGRAPH:2]El vasallaje suele ser de naturaleza tribal.

		<English>[TAB]Bureaucracy is a form of government in which a professional class manages the day to day operations of the government. They collect the taxes. They build the roads. They turn the ruler's wishes into actuality. The Chinese mandarins are an early example of a bureaucracy; the motor vehicle agency of your local government is a later example. [PARAGRAPH:2]Bureaucracies provide a certain amount of stability and competence to a government, ensuring that the government will continue to operate efficiently even if the old ruler is thrown out and a new and totally inexperienced ruler takes his or her place. Over time, though, a bureaucracy may become "entrenched" - growing in size and inefficiency to the point where it is extremely difficult for a leader to accomplish anything - good or ill.</English>

[PARAGRAPH:2]La bureaucratie assure une certaine stabilit&#233; du pouvoir et met des comp&#233;tences au service des gouvernements. Ainsi, m&#234;me lorsqu'un dirigeant inexp&#233;riment&#233; arrive au pouvoir, le gouvernement continue de fonctionner avec une certaine efficacit&#233;. Cependant, la bureaucratie a tendance &#224; prolif&#233;rer et &#224; perdre en efficacit&#233;, au point de paralyser quelque peu le pouvoir et de l'emp&#234;cher de r&#233;aliser quoi que ce soit.</French>

[PARAGRAPH:2]Le burocrazie garantiscono la stabilit&#224; e la competenza di un governo, assicurandone il funzionamento efficiente persino nella successione tra un vecchio leader in favore di uno nuovo totalmente inesperto. Nel corso del tempo, la burocrazia pu&#242; trasformarsi in una "trincea": con l'espansione della burocrazia, infatti, aumenta di conseguenza l'inefficienza del sistema al punto che, per un leader, diventa impossibile compiere qualsiasi azione, nel bene e nel male.</Italian>

		<English>[TAB]The term "free speech" describes a legal system in which a person cannot be stopped from saying anything he or she wants, as long as the speech doesn't cause immediate harm to those around him or her - even in the freest society, it is still illegal to shout "Fire!" in a crowded movie theatre. [PARAGRAPH:2]The benefits of free speech are many. The citizens may debate their government's policies and actions fully, without fear of punishment. A free press allows the citizens great access to news and information, allowing them to more accurately judge the events taking place in the world around them. Tyrants and despots rightly fear free speech more than almost anything else. On the other hand, free speech may be hate speech; it may be lies. Such speech must be allowed: once a government is allowed to determine which speech is to be allowed and which is to be suppressed, the temptation to abuse that power is overwhelming, and speech isn't free any more.</English>

In a tribe everyone knows everybody else; who is strong and who is weak, who is intelligent and who is not, who is skilled and who is unskilled. [PARAGRAPH:2]Leadership in the tribe is usually determined by merit, according to the tribe's needs: if the tribe is hungry, the best hunter becomes the leader. If the tribe is surrounded by enemies, the best warrior is chosen. And so forth. A tribe must quickly learn how to pick successful leaders; otherwise it will perish. [PARAGRAPH:2]Tribalism tends to break down when the tribe becomes overly large. People no longer know everyone in their tribe. Groups (or factions) appear, and everyone no longer share the same objectives. The tribe must find a more sophisticated system of government or fracture into smaller squabbling units.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Slavery is a system whereby some people are judged far inferior to others and are treated as objects or possessions, with no more rights than those afforded to chairs or cattle. Slavery has existed as long as human history, from the earliest primitive times to the enlightened days of Greece and Rome and right up until today. Sometimes convicted criminals were made into slaves. Sometimes captured enemies of the state were enslaved. Sometimes people of a specific race or coloration were enslaved. In some civilizations a person could purchase their freedom or were allotted it after being enslaved for a specific period of time. [PARAGRAPH:2]The advantage of slavery is that it allows people to be forced to do jobs that they would otherwise refuse to do without adequate compensation. Cheap labor results in concentration of wealth and thus the creation of great buildings and temples or the maintenance of large professional armies. Aside from its basic moral repugnance, the disadvantages of slavery are numerous: it corrupts both slave and master, it badly underutilizes the intelligence and creativity of the subject people, and it almost inevitably leads to revolts and internal strife. </English>

		<English>[TAB]Serfdom is a more "enlightened" form of slavery in that the power of the master is not absolute and the serfs are accorded a certain number of rights. The specific rights and obligations of masters and serfs vary significantly over time and from place to place. In some societies, the master had the right to control every aspect of a serf's life except that he couldn't kill the serf without just cause; in others, the serfs had the rights to marry and to inherit wealth and to a certain amount of self-government, but they could not leave the land without their lord's permission. [PARAGRAPH:2]The basic premise of serfdom is that one group of people are superior to another, and that they have the political and god-given right to control the other group's destiny. Thus serfdom only makes sense if one agrees with the group currently in power about who is superior to whom. </English>
		<French>[TAB]Le servage est une forme plus "&#233;clair&#233;e" d'esclavage, dans laquelle le ma&#238;tre n'a pas un pouvoir absolu, et le serf dispose de certains droits. Les droits et obligations du ma&#238;tre et de l'esclave varient de mani&#232;re significative selon l'&#233;poque et le lieu. Dans certaines soci&#233;t&#233;s, le ma&#238;tre avait le droit de contr&#244;ler tous les aspects de la vie du serf, mais ne pouvait pas le tuer sans raison. Ailleurs, les serfs avaient le droit de se marier, de transmettre leur patrimoine et disposaient d'une certaine autonomie, mais ils ne pouvaient pas quitter leur terre sans l'accord de leur seigneur. [PARAGRAPH:2]Le principe de base du servage est qu'il existe un groupe d'individus sup&#233;rieurs aux autres. Ils ont politiquement et id&#233;ologiquement le droit de contr&#244;ler la destin&#233;e des autres. Ainsi, le servage n'a de sens que si la sup&#233;riorit&#233; des uns est accept&#233;e par les autres. </French>

Allerdings darf er das Land ohne die Zustimmung seines Herrn nicht verlassen. [PARAGRAPH:2]Die Voraussetzung der Leibeigenschaft ist eine Gesellschaftsschicht, die das politische bzw. gottgegebene Recht hat, &#252;ber das Schicksal einer untergeordneten Schicht zu bestimmen.

		<English>[TAB]The state property civic describes an economy in which the citizens have no private property: everything belongs to the State. The State owns the factories, the farms, the universities, the grocery stores and virtually everything else. A citizen may own his or her clothing, furniture, and vehicle, but everything else he has is given to him by the State, and may be taken away any time the State sees fit. [PARAGRAPH:2]In a utopian society there would be no need for private property. Each person would contribute his or her best to the State; in return the State would distribute its largess according to each citizen's needs. Unfortunately, state property is quite a bit less fair when applied in real life. The State determines what each person gets, but often those decisions are based upon the citizen's political orthodoxy, family connections, or ability to pay bribes. The citizens feel that they are not rewarded for the quality of their efforts, and thus they see no point in achieving excellence. Innovation is pointless if one doesn't personally benefit from the innovation.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Environmentalism is the civic which describes a society in which every effort is made to remain in balance with nature. Emphasis is placed upon renewable resources and energy, and every possible item is recycled. This of course describes the ideal; no modern society on earth of any size can as yet achieve perfect harmony with the world around it. [PARAGRAPH:2]There are many benefits to environmentalism, not the least of which is that it would ensure that mankind will not suffocate under the weight of its own greed and pollution. The population of a fully "green" society would live longer and healthier lives, secure in the knowledge that their children and grandchildren would enjoy the same beautiful world that they did. [PARAGRAPH:2]Unfortunately, such changes will come slowly, if at all. Rich and powerful nations are extremely reluctant to cut back on the resources they consume, and loathe to implement the kind of political and market reforms that such an economy would require. Meanwhile the poorer countries wish to attain all of the power and wealth currently enjoyed by the rich: to them a smokestack is a symbol of progress, not of the ongoing destruction of the earth. Radical change will have to wait for the time when the magnitude and imminence of disaster is visible to everyone.</English>

In teoria, questi uomini sono gli unici portavoce del volere di Dio, il dissenso politico &#232; un peccato e pu&#242; essere considerato addirittura eresia. [PARAGRAPH:2]Nel mondo moderno, le teocrazie tendono a guardare indietro, nel tentativo di riportare la propria nazione in qualche mitico stato di grazia appartenente al passato, lontano dal male e dalla corruzione. Per alcune nazioni, la diplomazia tende ad essere molto difficoltosa: se un paese agisce contro gli interessi di una teocrazia viene visto come un gesto del diavolo, piuttosto che una necessit&#224; e un differente punto di vista.

En teor&#237;a, es voluntad de Dios que el gobierno est&#233; en sus manos, y el disenso pol&#237;tico es pecaminoso y moralmente condenable, cuando no directamente her&#233;tico. [PARAGRAPH:2]En nuestros tiempos, las teocracias son sistemas caracterizados por una noci&#243;n nost&#225;lgica de la historia, que aspiran a devolver la tierra a un pasado de gracia (normalmente m&#237;tico) y apartarla de la maldad y corrupci&#243;n del mundo moderno. Los pa&#237;ses que la practican tienen grandes dificultades diplom&#225;ticas, puesto que consideran que los estados que se les oponen act&#250;an impulsados por una voluntad diab&#243;lica en lugar de por sus propios puntos de vista e intereses. &#191;C&#243;mo va a llegar a un acuerdo un l&#237;der santo con un siervo de Sat&#225;n?</Spanish>

		<English>[TAB]Pacifism is the religious belief that all conflict is against the will of God. Man must not fight against his fellow man. If a person slaps your face, simply turn the other cheek. Basically, what happens to a person in this world really doesn't matter much at all: if a bully takes your stuff or kills you and you don't fight back, you will gain your reward in heaven (or in your next incarnation). The bully may enjoy his ill-gotten gains for a few paltry years in this world, but he will suffer tenfold in the next. [PARAGRAPH:2]Pacifism seems to enjoy popularity among people or nations who have little power of their own, people who cannot physically resist their oppressors with any hope of success. Once such people gain power and gain some measure of control over their destinies, however, they often discard their pacifism for more militant beliefs.</English>
		<French>[TAB]Le pacifisme est la croyance religieuse selon laquelle tout conflit va &#224; l'encontre de la volont&#233; de Dieu. Les hommes ne doivent pas se battre entre eux. Si quelqu'un vous frappe, tendez l'autre joue. En r&#233;sum&#233;, ce qu'un homme subit dans ce monde importe peu : si une brute vous vole ou vous assassine et que vous ne vous d&#233;fendez pas, vous acc&#233;derez au paradis (ou &#224; votre prochaine r&#233;incarnation). La brute, elle, profitera de ses crimes pendant quelques ann&#233;es, mais conna&#238;tra mille souffrances apr&#232;s sa mort. [PARAGRAPH:2]Le pacifisme est tr&#232;s populaire au sein des peuples et des nations qui ont peu de pouvoir et ne peuvent pas r&#233;sister physiquement &#224; leurs agresseurs. Bien souvent, ces peuples, une fois qu'ils ont acquis un certain pouvoir et qu'ils ma&#238;trisent quelque peu leur destin&#233;e, renoncent au pacifisme.</French>
		<German>[TAB]Der Pazifismus lehrt, dass jeder Streit gegen den Willen Gottes verst&#246;&#223;t, und verbietet den Menschen, gegeneinander zu k&#228;mpfen. "Wenn dich jemand schl&#228;gt, halte ihm auch die andere Wange hin" ist ein typisches Konzept des Pazifismus: Wird ein Mensch get&#246;tet, kann er sicher sein, dass er im Himmel (oder in seiner n&#228;chsten Inkarnation) f&#252;r alles entsch&#228;digt wird. Der M&#246;rder hingegen kann sein armseliges Leben zwar noch einige Jahre genie&#223;en, muss nach seinem Tod aber zehnfach f&#252;r seine Taten b&#252;&#223;en. [PARAGRAPH:2]Der Pazifismus ist vor allem in schwachen oder unterdr&#252;ckten L&#228;ndern weit verbreitet. Gewinnt eine Gesellschaft aber an Einfluss, weicht der Pazifismus nicht selten militanteren Konzepten.</German>
		<Italian>[TAB]Il pacifismo &#232; il credo religioso secondo il quale tutti i conflitti sono contrari al volere di Dio. Gli uomini non devono combattere tra loro; se una persona ti d&#224; uno schiaffo, porgi l'altra guancia. Fondamentalmente, ci&#242; che accade a una persona in questo mondo non conta molto: se si viene derubati o uccisi e non si reagisce, si conquister&#224; il Paradiso (magari nella successiva incarnazione). Il ladro o l'assassino potranno godersi i risultati del loro operato in questa vita, ma soffriranno dieci volte tanto in quella successiva. [PARAGRAPH:2]Il pacifismo gode di molta popolarit&#224; nelle nazioni deboli, i cui abitanti non potrebbero opporsi fisicamente agli oppressori. Quando queste persone conquistano il potere e il controllo sui propri destini, tuttavia, spesso abbandonano il pacifismo in cambio di un credo pi&#249; battagliero.</Italian>
		<Spanish>[TAB]El pacifismo es la creencia religiosa en que todo conflicto contradice la voluntad de Dios. El hombre no debe luchar contra el hombre. Si alguien te abofetea, ofr&#233;cele la otra mejilla. B&#225;sicamente, lo que le ocurre en el mundo real a la persona que lo practica no tiene demasiada importancia: si alguien te roba o te asesina sin que te defiendas, recibir&#225;s tu recompensa en el cielo (o en tu pr&#243;xima encarnaci&#243;n). El otro puede disfrutar de lo robado durante unos pocos a&#241;os, pero al final acabar&#225; pag&#225;ndolo con creces en la otra vida. [PARAGRAPH:2]El pacifismo goza de gran predicamento entre aquellos pueblos o naciones que no poseen mucho poder y que son incapaces de ofrecer resistencia a sus opresores. Sin embargo, en cuanto su poder aumenta y obtienen alg&#250;n control sobre su destino, suelen renunciar al pacifismo para abrazar creencias m&#225;s belicosas.</Spanish>

		<English>[TAB]Free religion refers to a society in which no single religion is dominant, in which people are free to worship or not worship as they please. There is no state religion; the government is totally secular. [PARAGRAPH:2]Such states allow all to express their religious beliefs. This encourages immigration by people whose religions are suppressed elsewhere, and the general society benefits from the multitude of experiences and beliefs of its members. However, such freedom and tolerance of religions may weaken a nation's people's beliefs in any religion, which could cause the people to become morally lax and decadent. Further, members of the more militant and expansionist religions may seek to destroy the competition, causing a good deal of stress and conflict within a country. A good deal of maturity is required on the part of a government and its people to successfully sustain free religion.</English>

Il n'y a pas de religion d'Etat. Le gouvernement est totalement la&#239;c. [PARAGRAPH:2]De tels Etats permettent que l'on exprime ses croyances religieuses. Ceci encourage l'immigration de populations dont la religion est ailleurs r&#233;prim&#233;e, et toute la soci&#233;t&#233; b&#233;n&#233;ficie de la diversit&#233; des cultures de sa population. Cependant, une telle libert&#233; et tol&#233;rance religieuse risque d'affaiblir le sentiment religieux de toute la nation. Ceci peut provoquer un rel&#226;chement de la morale. De m&#234;me, les croyants des religions les plus militantes peuvent essayer d'en profiter pour assurer leur domination, provoquant alors des conflits &#224; l'int&#233;rieur du pays. Pour r&#233;ussir, la libert&#233; de culte demande donc une grande maturit&#233; de la part du gouvernement et du peuple.</French>

Es gibt keine Staatsreligion und eine strenge Trennung von Kirche und Staat. [PARAGRAPH:2]Da in L&#228;ndern mit Religionsfreiheit das Recht der freien Religionsaus&#252;bung gilt, ist die Zuwanderungsrate von Menschen, die in ihrer Heimat aufgrund ihres Glaubens verfolgt werden, sehr hoch. In der Regel profitiert die Gesellschaft von der religi&#246;sen Vielschichtigkeit ihrer Mitglieder. Allerdings k&#246;nnen Religionsfreiheit und Toleranz im Extremfall auch zum Niedergang des Glaubens f&#252;hren. Dar&#252;ber hinaus wird die Religionsfreiheit immer wieder von militanten Gruppierungen missbraucht. Die Erhaltung der Religionsfreiheit in offenen Gesellschaften ist daher eine der gr&#246;&#223;ten Herausforderungen der Zukunft.</German>

		<English>[TAB]An inquisitorial system is a legal system where the court or a part of the court is actively involved in determining the facts of the case, as opposed to an adversarial system where the role of the court is solely that of an impartial referee between parties. Inquisitorial systems are used in most countries in Europe and Latin America. [PARAGRAPH:2]Until the Medieval inquisition in the 12th century, the legal systems used in medieval Europe generally relied on the adversarial system to determine whether someone should be tried and whether that person is guilty or innocent. Under this system, unless a person was caught in the act of committing a crime, they could not be tried for a crime until they had been formally accused, either by the voluntary accusations of a sufficient number of witnesses or by an inquest (an early form of grand jury) convened specifically for that purpose. A weakness of this system was that because it relied on the voluntary accusations of witnesses, and because the penalties for making a false accusation were severe, would-be witnesses could be hesitant to actually make their accusations to the court, for fear of implicating themselves. Because of the difficulties in deciding cases, procedures such as ordeal or combat were accepted, though it is generally agreed nowadays that these procedures are not acceptable ways of finding truth or settling a dispute. [PARAGRAPH:2]Beginning in 1198, Pope Innocent III issued a series of decretals that reformed the ecclesiastical court system. Under the new processus per inquisitionem (inquisitional procedure) an ecclesiastical magistrate no longer required a formal accusation to summon and try a defendant. Instead, an ecclesiastical court could summon and interrogate witnesses of its own initiative, and if the (possibly secret) testimony of those witnesses accused a person of a crime, that person could then be summoned and tried. In 1215, the Fourth Council of the Lateran affirmed the use of the inquisitional system. The council also forbade clergy from conducting trials by ordeal or combat. As a result, in parts of continental Europe, the ecclesiastical courts operating under the inquisitional procedure became the dominant method by which disputes were adjudicated. In France, the parlements  lay courts  employed inquisitorial proceedings. [PARAGRAPH:2]In the development of modern legal institutions which occurred in the 19th century, for the most part, most jurisdictions did not only codify their private law and criminal law, but the rules of civil procedure were reviewed and codified as well. It was through this movement that the role of an inquisitorial system became enshrined in most European civilian legal systems. However, there exist significant differences of operating methods and procedures between 18th century ancien regime courts and 19th century courts; in particular, limits on the powers of investigators were typically added, as well as increased rights of the defense.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Apprenticeship is a system of training a new generation of skilled crafts practitioners. Apprentices (or in early modern usage "prentices") build their careers from apprenticeships. Most of their training is done on the job while working for an employer who helps the apprentices learn their trade. An informal, theoretical education may also be involved. [PARAGRAPH:2]The system of apprenticeship first developed in the later Middle Ages and came to be supervised by craft guilds and town governments. A master craftsman was entitled to employ young people as an inexpensive form of labour in exchange for providing formal training in the craft. Most apprentices were males, but female apprentices were found in a number of crafts associated with embroidery, silk-weaving etc. Apprentices were young (usually about fourteen to twenty-one years of age), unmarried and would live in the master craftsman's household. Most apprentices aspired to becoming master craftsmen themselves on completion of their contract (usually a term of seven years), but some would spend time as a journeyman and a significant proportion would never acquire their own workshop.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Herbalism is a traditional medicinal or folk medicine practice based on the use of plants and plant extracts. Herbalism is also known as botanical medicine, medicinal botany, medical herbalism, herbal medicine, herbology, and phytotherapy. Sometimes the scope of herbal medicine is extended to include fungi and bee products, as well as minerals, shells and certain animal parts. [PARAGRAPH:2]Many plants synthesize substances that are useful to the maintenance of health in humans and other animals. These include aromatic substances, most of which are phenols or their oxygen-substituted derivatives such as tannins. Many are secondary metabolites, of which at least 12,000 have been isolated  a number estimated to be less than 10% of the total. In many cases, these substances (particularly the alkaloids) serve as plant defense mechanisms against predation by microorganisms, insects, and herbivores. Many of the herbs and spices used by humans to season food yield useful medicinal compounds. [PARAGRAPH:2]In the written record, the study of herbs dates back over 5,000 years to the Sumerians, who described well-established medicinal uses for such plants as laurel, caraway, and thyme. The first known Chinese herb book (or herbal), dating from about 2700 B.C., lists 365 medicinal plants and their uses - including ma-Huang, the shrub that introduced the drug ephedrine to modern medicine. The Egyptians of 1000 B.C. are known to have used garlic, opium, castor oil, coriander, mint, indigo, and other herbs for medicine and the Old Testament also mentions herb use and cultivation, including mandrake, vetch, caraway, wheat, barley, and rye.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The term public school has different (and in some cases contradictory) meanings due to regional differences. In most of the world, it refers to a government-funded primary or secondary school; in some countries, it can refer to government-funded higher education; in England, Wales and Northern Ireland it refers to certain elite, private primary and secondary schools. [PARAGRAPH:2]In many English-speaking nations (but only in Scotland within the United Kingdom), a public school is a school that is financed and run by the government and does not charge tuition fees in order for children to attend. This is in contrast to a private school (also known as an "independent school"). Here, the word "public" is used in the sense of "public library", i.e. provided to the public at public expense. These public schools range in classes from kindergarten to four years of high school or secondary school, normally lasting until one is 17/18 years of age. [PARAGRAPH:2]There are variations on the name, such as "state school", which is used in the UK and some other countries. In Hong Kong they are called "government schools".</English>

Shamans have the ability to diagnose and cure human suffering and, in some societies, the ability to cause suffering. This is believed to be accomplished by traversing the axis mundi and forming a special relationship with, or gaining control over, spirits. Shamans have been credited with the ability to control the weather, divination, the interpretation of dreams, astral projection, and traveling to upper and lower worlds. Shamanistic traditions have existed throughout the world since prehistoric times. [PARAGRAPH:2]Shamanism is based on the premise that the visible world is pervaded by invisible forces or spirits that affect the lives of the living. In contrast to animism and animatism, which any and usually all members of a society practice, shamanism requires specialized knowledge or abilities. It could be said that shamans are the experts employed by animists and animist communities. Shamans are often organized into full-time ritual or spiritual associations, like priests. In Indian culture as well there are those who are called tantrics and are said to have the power to control spirits and force them to do their bidding. People often visit them for many reasons but most often it is to ensure the spirit's aid in their work or to curse someone who they feel is an enemy of theirs or opposes them.</English>

These civic assemblies are known as corporations (not necessarily the business model known as a 'corporation', though such businesses are not excluded from the definition either). Corporations are unelected bodies with an internal hierarchy; their purpose is to exert control over the social and economic life of their respective areas.

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_CIVIC_SEPARATION_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB]Secularism or secularity are also used in the meaning of Lacit, a concept related to the separation of state and religion. Secularity is the state of being free from religious or spiritual qualities. For instance, eating a meal, playing a game, or bathing are examples of secular activities, because there is nothing inherently religious about them. Saying a prayer or visiting a place of worship are examples of non-secular activities. An approximate synonym for secular is worldly; although this is often used from a Christian point of view. Secularism has two distinct meanings.[NEWLINE][TAB]1. It asserts the freedom of religion, and freedom from religion, within a state that is neutral on matters of belief, and gives no state privileges or subsidies to religions.[NEWLINE][TAB]2. It refers to a belief that human activities and decisions should be based on evidence and fact, and not superstitious beliefs, however devoutly held, and that policy should be free from religious domination. For example, a society deciding whether to promote condom use might consider the issues of disease prevention, family planning, and women's rights. A secularist would argue that such issues are relevant to public policy-making, whereas Biblical interpretation or church doctrine should not be considered and are irrelevant.</English>
		<French>[TAB]Le s&#233;cularisme ou le secularity sont &#233;galement employ&#233;s dans la signification de Lacit, un concept li&#233; &#224; la s&#233;paration de l'&#233;tat et de la religion. Le secularity est l'&#233;tat d'&#234;tre exempt des qualit&#233;s religieuses ou spirituelles. Par exemple, manger un repas, le jeu d'un jeu, ou se baigner sont des exemples des activit&#233;s s&#233;culaires, parce qu'il n'y a rien en soi religieux au sujet d'elles. Dire une pri&#232;re ou visiter un endroit de culte sont des exemples des activit&#233;s non-s&#233;culaires. Un synonyme approximatif pour s&#233;culaire est mondain ; bien que ceci soit souvent employ&#233; d'un point de vue chr&#233;tien. Le s&#233;cularisme a deux meanings.[NEWLINE][TAB]1 distincts. Il affirme la libert&#233; religieuse, et l'absence de la religion, dans un d&#233;clarer qui est neutre sur la croyance, et ne donne aucun privil&#232;ge ou subvention d'&#233;tat &#224; religions.[NEWLINE][TAB]2. Il se rapporte &#224; une croyance que des activit&#233;s et les d&#233;cisions humaines devraient &#234;tre bas&#233;es sur l'&#233;vidence et le fait, et &#224; la croyance non superstitieuse, toutefois devoutly tenu, et que la politique devrait &#234;tre exempte de la domination religieuse. Par exemple, une soci&#233;t&#233; d&#233;cidant si favoriser l'utilisation de condom pourrait consid&#233;rer les questions de l'emp&#234;chement de la maladie, de la planification de famille, et des droits des femmes. Un mat&#233;rialiste arguerait du fait que de telles questions sont appropri&#233;es &#224; d&#233;finissant la politique public, tandis que la doctrine biblique d'interpr&#233;tation ou d'&#233;glise ne devrait pas &#234;tre consid&#233;r&#233;e et est non pertinente.</French>

Ein ungef&#228;hres Synonym f&#252;r weltliches ist worldly; obgleich dieses h&#228;ufig von einem christlichen Gesichtspunkt verwendet wird. Secularism hat zwei eindeutige meanings.[NEWLINE][TAB]1. Es erkl&#228;rt die Freiheit der Religion und Freiheit von der Religion, innerhalb eines Zustandes, der bez&#252;glich des Glaubens Null ist, und gibt keine Zustandprivilegien oder -beihilfe zu religions.[NEWLINE][TAB]2. Es bezieht sich einen Glauben, da&#223; menschliche T&#228;tigkeiten und Entscheidungen auf Beweis und Tatsache basieren sollten, und auf nicht abergl&#228;ubischen Glauben, gleichwohl devoutly gehalten und da&#223; Politik von der frommen Herrschaft frei sein sollte. Z.B. eine Gesellschaft, die ob man Kondomgebrauch entscheidet, konnte die Ausgaben der Krankheitverhinderung, der Familie Planung und der Rechte der Frauen betrachten f&#246;rdert.

		<English>[TAB]The Industrial Revolution was the major technological, socioeconomic and cultural change in the late 18th and early 19th century that began in Britain and spread throughout the world. During that time, an economy based on manual labour was replaced by one dominated by industry and the manufacture of machinery. It began with the mechanisation of the textile industries and the development of iron-making techniques, and trade expansion was enabled by the introduction of canals, improved roads and then railways. The introduction of steam power (fuelled primarily by coal) and powered machinery (mainly in textile manufacturing) underpinned the dramatic increases in production capacity. The development of all-metal machine tools in the first two decades of the 19th century facilitated the manufacture of more production machines for manufacturing in other industries. The period of time covered by the Industrial Revolution varies with different historians. Eric Hobsbawm held that it 'broke out' in the 1780s and wasn't fully felt until the 1830s or 1840s[2], while T.S. Ashton held that it occurred roughly between 1760 and 1830 (in effect the reigns of George III, The Regency, and George IV).</English>
