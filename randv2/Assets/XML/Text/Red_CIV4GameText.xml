		<English>Entertainment always has been prominent in society despite today’s skeptical perception that a doctor earns several times less than a famous celebrity for the amount of time invested. In Rome, gladiators were quite popular with housewives of both the plebian and nobility alike. Actors in the Renaissance Europe enjoyed fame and at times immunity from some crimes and today’s society of entertainment is no exception to the rule. In exchange for their pride and personal space and a very low career security, they could potentially live lavishly in cultural capitals such as Hollywood and New York being worshipped by people as entertainment icons. The Entertainment Moguls often take advantage of that by setting up contracts and hiring agents who get paid relative to the success of their star to be. While the benefits of becoming a celebrity these days can be great, so are the drawbacks. The paparazzi seeks any opportunity to pull a smear job on their target, the reviewers are often insatiable critics who at time hates certain stars on principle and the ever demanding agents puts them through a stressful schedule with little choice in what they do and a less than stable domestic life. Still with money being a source of happiness and entertainment a seemingly inexhaustible well of money, it is no wonder why the entertainment industry is so powerful especially in this time.</English>
