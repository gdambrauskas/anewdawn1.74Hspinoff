XML changes:
CIV4EspionageMissionInfo:
	<iCityPoisonWaterCounter>5</iCityPoisonWaterCounter>

OUTSTANDING ISSUES:
	Remove the SS assassination icon altogether (can only remove SDK references. CIV4MissionInfos has to stay for new game and assassinate.dds has to stay generally)
	Could be some issue with Fassert message at new game start with CvSelectionGroup possibly an extra break; in a case switch statement.
	Final testing
	
AI ESPIONAGE DECISION TREE (prototype):
	if not in a big espionage plan and if considering a war, or otherwise if generally annoyed:
		- 05destroy improvement (10, 2, 60, 2, 10, 18, 36, 1, 20, 20, 10, 7, 13, 21, 1, 20, 7, 36, 1, 10, 9, 5)
		- bribe
	if in a city:
		if annoyed:
			if not in a big espionage plan:
				- 06destroy building (27, 99, 106, 136, 6, 2, 45, 525, 113, 160, 225, 153, 136, 265, 161, 174, 208, 158)
			- destroy project
			if not in a big espionage plan:
				- 11poisonings (256 [iAverageUnhealth=4,11,12,8], 64, 704, 768, 512 )
				- 08destroy production (8, 11, 27, 33, 105, 10, 90, 41, 54, 137)
				- steal treasury RIP (AIespionageVal always -ve because iData from CvUnitAI is always -1)
			if at war:
				- 13incite revolt (45, )
				- anarchy RIP 
			- assassinate
		if annoyed, have memory and counter espionage points run out:
			- 17counter espionage (104, 108, 112, 104, 106, 106, 108, 106, 105)
		- 14steal technology (10940, 180, 720, 780)

		- 19bribe (100, 100, )
	if in a city:

			- destroy project
			if not in a big espionage plan:

			- 18assassinate (1000 4 32771 AD1765, 1000 0 8192 AD1870, )
		if annoyed, have memory and counter espionage points run out:
			- 17counter espionage ()
		- 14steal technology (580, 1040, 520, 10060 owner 2 AD1)
			

Adding the Assassin mission to the AI:

The mission itself for example MISSION_ESPIONAGE or MISSION_ASSASSINATE, 
can be assigned from the user interface or pushed. 
In all these cases, CvSelectionGroup allocates the mission code to execute.
Sometimes, the AI code executes mission code independently of CvSelectionGroup....

- Add the assassination mission to the XML file CIV4EspionageMissionInfo.xml
	- Create new mission ESPIONAGEMISSION_ASSASSINATE
		- make destroyUnitCostFactor > 0
	- Create new mission ESPIONAGEMISSION_BRIBE
		- make BuyUnitCostFactor > 0

- CvUnitAI::AI_spyMove() triggers CvUnit:espionage() via a spy unit:
	- calls AI_espionageSpy if spy is on foreign soil
		- calls CvPlayerAI:AI_bestPlotEspionage
			- Assign the intention to perform some espionage
			- Program an assassination weight into CvPlayerAI::AI_espionageVal
			- Add the assassination mission to CvPlayerAI::AI_bestPlotEspionage
		- calls CvPlayer::canDoEspionage and asks if there are enough points etc
		- calls CvUnit::espionage and does the espionage:
			- Execute the mission in CvPlayer::doEspionageMission
				- MODIFY espionage mission cost at CvPlayer::getEspionageMissionCost
					- MODIFY espionage mission cost at CvPlayer::getEspionageMissionBaseCost
					- CvPlayer::getEspionageMissionCostModifier adds espionage context costs
			- Execute similar code to CvUnit::assassin
		- conduct espionage activities like intercept
	- calls CvUnitAI::AI_guardSpy(0%) search for the best city to guard and go there.
	- calls AI_bonusOffenseSpy(3Maxpath) search the path for the best HOME plot using AI_getEspionageTargetValue and go there
	- calls AI_cityOffenseSpy(10range) search for other players cities (valid pLoopCity->area() == area()) using AI_getEspionageTargetValue and go there
	- calls CvUnitAI::AI_reconSpy(3range) search for any plots that have not been revealed or are not visible and go there
	- calls AI_cityOffenseSpy(10range)
	- calls AI_retreatToCity
	- calls AI_safety
	
- Add the user interface to the new missions in CvDLLButtonPopup.cpp::launchEspionageDoTargetPopup()

There is distinct possibility that CvUnit::assassin() does not program in the chance of a negative diplomatic hit on the assassinator's origin nation.
Reduce the AI's use of city poisoning

The game help text needs to be changed for destroy unit cost factor at CvGameTextMgr::setEspionageCostHelp
