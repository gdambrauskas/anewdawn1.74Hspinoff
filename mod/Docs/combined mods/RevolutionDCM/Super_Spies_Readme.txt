-----Missions (Glider1)---------------
Assassination:
- a spy either human or AI, can assassinate a great specialist in a city. 
  The mission is disabled by default in order not to disturb game balance but can be re-enabled in CIV4EspionageMissionInfo.xml:
  <iDestroyUnitCostFactor>1</iDestroyUnitCostFactor> under the assassination mission section.
  The cost of the mission and other parameters such as probabilities of success can be changed as per any standard espionage mission in the same file.

Bribery
- a spy either human or AI, can bribe a single worker for an espionage cost.
  The mission is disabled by default in order not to disturb game balance but can be re-enabled in CIV4EspionageMissionInfo.xml:
  <iBuyUnitCostFactor>1</iBuyUnitCostFactor> under the bribery mission section.
  The cost of the mission and other parameters such as probabilities of success can be changed as per any standard espionage mission in the same file.
  
-----Notes to Modmakers-----

If you want to use the spy promotions in your mod I have tried to make things as 
easy as possible for you. In the SDK files I have added  
//TSHEEP and //TSHEEP End in all of the places 
that I have made changes to the original files.

I attempted to keep the XML modular, but apparently promotions aren't modular friendly.
They conflict in the weirdest ways if you try, so be warned.

There is only one python addition thus far which is this statement, you should be able to find it by searching for the "if" line:
if (gc.getTeam(gc.getGame().getActiveTeam()).getCounterespionageTurnsLeftAgainstTeam(eTeam) != 0):
	szTempBuffer = u"(%d)%c" %(gc.getTeam(gc.getGame().getActiveTeam()).getCounterespionageTurnsLeftAgainstTeam(eTeam), CyGame().getSymbolID(FontSymbols.OCCUPATION_CHAR))
	szBuffer = szBuffer + szTempBuffer



-----Version Information-----

-----v1.30 (Glider1) -----
This mod is not not compatible with base BTS yet and requires RevolutionDCM
Removed assassination mission as per version 1.23  because it was not implemented as per BTS standard
Re-implemented assassination mission as per BTS standard (see assets/xml/gameinfo/CIV4EspionageMissionInfo.xml). The mission is "off" by default in order not to disturb game balance.
Introduced a bribery mission as per BTS standard (see assets/xml/gameinfo/CIV4EspionageMissionInfo.xml). The mission is "off by default in order not to disturb game balance.
Tweaked the AI's urge to poison cities down just a little, using XML (/assets/xml/gameinfo/CIV4EspionageMissionInfo.xml). This results in the AI using other minor espionage missions a little more often.

-----v1.23----
Fixed - CTDs! Finally discovered the bugs and smashed them over and over again. Reimplemented Modular XML as it was not to blame.

-----v1.22----
More Attempts...
