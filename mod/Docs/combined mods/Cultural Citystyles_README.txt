Cultural Citystyles
Beyond the Sword 3.19 - mod version 0.90

Description:
This mod is made to make the civilizations more culturally diverse with the available art made by freelance modders and unused art by Firaxis.
Basically, citysets of the different artstyle groups have been changed/altered until the Modern Era, where ever art was available for it. The future era is in general the same for all artstyles. In some cases you'll still see the normal ingame cityset buildings, which means I haven't found art for those spots or I intended it to remain there. Also, for some units and buildings new .dds files are included which I felt made them look better without altering the basic model of it.
Besides citystyles, new facility -and improvement art is included for the different artstyles. This part still needs some work. Included is Sepamu92's fishingboat modcomponent. 


The new artstyles in this mod sofar are ANGLO AMERICA, AFRICA, ARABIA, EGYPT, CRESCENT, IBERIA, INDIA, JAPAN, RUSSIA, MONGOLIA, NORSE, SOUTH EAST ASIA, NATIVE AMERICA and MESO AMERICA. Work is in progress for the Anglo-American, Mongolian and South-American artstyles.
Don't expect truly different citystyles in all cases tho. Quite a number of them are hybrids, especially the Indian -and Khmer civ. The main new thing is that from the Industrial era on a mix of old and new city buildings are used. For instance in the Modern era you'll see Industrial city art and modern flats mixed for the European civs.

Installment:
Simply unzip the download to your Beyond the Sword/mods folder, check if there are NO double folders of "Cultural Citystyles" (Beyond the Sword/mods/Cultural Citystyles/Cultural Citystyles). Lastly, check if your CivilizationIV.config AND your CivilizationIV.ini files have Modular Loading enabled (should be 1).
