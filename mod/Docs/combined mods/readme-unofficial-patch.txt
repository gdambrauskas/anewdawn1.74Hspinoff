Changes (order is bottom to top):

* AI plane/ship retreating logic when city is in danger extended to Forts
* Vassal's spies no longer caught in master's territory
* AI logic on banning nukes tweaked to account for AI leader personality and the global situation
* Undid galley production changes from Better BtS AI
* Non-native collateral damage tweaked (thanks guys)
* Civilopedia will now display "replaced by" lines for buildings that get replaced by UBs
* AI guided missiles will lean towards destroying resource-producing tiles as opposed to improvements like Towns
* Damaged AI attack planes may choose to continue attacking if no defending interceptors are around
* Rivers running through deserts will result in floodplains
* Start location tweaks per SevenSpirits
* Workers not as lazy, per Bhruic's patch
* Glance screen reactivated
	* AI will try to retreat air assets from endangered cities
	* AI will no longer refuse to retreat damaged planes
	* AI will change civics during Golden Ages

	* AI may now try to use Warlords to create super-medic units
	* Fixed bug that prevented random events that target a unit from triggering
	*  Access to the Barrage line removed from armored units. If units with access to Barrage and no inherent collateral damage are modded in, they will work.

    * Fixed overproduction of transports in land wars courtesy of better BtS AI team.

    * Civilopedia and mouseover help for units that cause collateral damage will now show the collateral damage limit (50% for Catapults, etc.)
    * Somewhat experimental AI change: Aggressive AI now considerably less likely to want peace if it poses more of an immediate threat to enemy cities than it currently faces itself.
    * Fixed unavailability of foreign civ demographics if playing with espionage disabled.
    * Barrage promotions made working again on Tanks and other units with no base collateral ability
