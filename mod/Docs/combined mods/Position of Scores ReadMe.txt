The mod 'Position of Scores' was designed for the BUG Mod (in Version 3.6) and other mods using BUG. It adds to the interface a score slider under the scoretable that appears when more scores have to be shown than allowed by the BUG option 'Maximum Civilizations' in the card 'Scoreboard'. The choosen limit counts for the advanced scoreboard as well as for the normal scoreboard.

So 'Position of Scores' is especially usefull when playing a game with lots of civilizations or when playing with a dynamic name mod like 'DCN - Dynamic Civ Names' or 'ADN - Advanced Dynamic Naming'.
