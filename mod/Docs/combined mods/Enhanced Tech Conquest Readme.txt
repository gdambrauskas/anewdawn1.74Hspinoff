Enhanced Tech Conquest v0.6
By: Grave, Jeckel

Patch Compatibility: Beyond the Sword v3.02 and v3.13
MP Compatible: ?

Description:

The Enhanced Tech Conquest Mod is designed to give a tech boost from conquering 
enemy cities. When an enemy city is conquered, a list of techs the enemy has 
that your empire doesn't is created. From that list a random tech is selected.


Installation Instructions:

1) Unzip this into the "warlords_install_folder\Mods\" folder. 
2) Open the CivilizationIV.ini configuration file
3) Change the Mod line to read: Mod = Mods\Enhanced Tech Conquest
4) Load the game. 
5) Then play as normal. 

-----Game Play-----

- Captured cities always give a minimum of 25% towards the cost of a tech plus 
  a random amount

- The random amount is from 0 to <city size * 5>%. For example a city of size 4 
  would give between 25% and 45% of the tech cost. This assumes the default
  configuration values have not been changed
  
- Cities greater than size 15 increase the chance of getting a full tech. For
  example a city of size 20 would give between 25% and 125% of the tech cost.
  This assumes the default configuration value has not been changed.

- Several configurable options allow tuning of how technology will get 
  transfered from the conquered city to the conquering civilization. 


-----Notes to Modmakers-----

In the Python files I have added # < Enhanced Tech Conquest Start > and 
# < Enhanced Tech Conquest End  > in all of the places that I have made changes 
to the original files.
