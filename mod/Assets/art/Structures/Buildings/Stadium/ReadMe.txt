XML Help Needed:I need help with making this a seperate building from the colosseum. If you have the XML talent to do this please do so, here is what I would like for the Stadium:

Technology reqirement: Steel

Other:A pedia entry, and rename all the stadium related files to "stadium".
The rest is for you to do. I have tried working with the XML but I am not good with it whatsoever.

If you do this you will get credit for your work
