		<English>[H1]Revolution[\H1][NEWLINE]by Jdog5000[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]The goal[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]This component allows sections of disgruntled empires to rise up together and demand changes or attempt to break away from the motherland. No matter what the source of the complaint, you will be given an option to either ignore the complaint or accept the cities demands. If their demands go unmet and situations deteriorate, the cities may give you an ultimatum and take up arms if you do not comply![PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]How it works[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]This component is intended to add realistic dynamics to the game, making keeping your cities and regions happy more important and challenging. Each city in your empire will have factors that make it want to stay and factors that make it want to rebel. If you cannot find a balance that keeps each of your cities happy, you will face revolts!  Revolts come in many different styles, including requests to change civics, requests to change state religion, and demands for independence.  No matter what the scenario, you will always be given choices when confronted with a rebellious city.[PARAGRAPH:2]This component has been updated to support Vassal states and other new features of Warlords. It also now incorporates most of the ideas from the prior Rebellion component. The AI logic appears bug free, but it's difficult to test all the human popup handling. However, it has undergone extensive testing and is in a good working state.[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]More Details[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]Each city has a Revolution Index, and when that index gets up towards 1000 they start to get restless. You will be warned whenever a city passes over 900 and about every 15 turns while it's in the danger zone, and once over 1000 it may instigate a revolution. Other nearby cities with rev indices over 600 can join in a revolution. If a city is unhappy, things are very similar but the minimum threshold for a revolution drops quickly with the number of unhappy citizens. There are several different Revolution styles and the situation in the Revolution instigating city determines the style. Many styles have peaceful and violent variants: denying a request will just agitate the city further, but denying a demand will lead to civil war![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In order of precedence:[NEWLINE][TAB][COLOR_HIGHLIGHT_TEXT]Return to or reform dominant culture:[COLOR_REVERT] Cities in which you don't have a majority culture will become increasing aggitated and may attempt to break away for cultural reasons. The instigator and nearby, similarly cultured cities will ask (peaceful) or demand (violent) to join or reform a dead rival. Denying this request will cause your relations with the rival to deteriorate, and they may choose to declare war![NEWLINE][TAB][COLOR_HIGHLIGHT_TEXT]Religious differences:[COLOR_REVERT]  Cities may ask for a change away from Theocracy or to Freedom of Religion, or to switch your state religion. They can also ask or demand independence for religious reasons.[NEWLINE][TAB][COLOR_HIGHLIGHT_TEXT]Homeland revolutions:[COLOR_REVERT] Ask for various different civics. May ask for you to go on a crusade to capture your religion's holy city.[NEWLINE][TAB][COLOR_HIGHLIGHT_TEXT]Colonial revolutions:[COLOR_REVERT] Ask for change to representative government. (Independence handled below)[NEWLINE][TAB][COLOR_HIGHLIGHT_TEXT]Capital or majority of cities revolting:[COLOR_REVERT] Cities will ask for changes in away from repressive civics, or for some form of a say in the government. They can also ask or demand a change in ruler! If you're running a representative government, accepting their requests will mean facing election. If you are replaced, the game will automate some number of turns and then return control to you (this feature can be disabled). [NEWLINE][TAB][COLOR_HIGHLIGHT_TEXT]Independence:[COLOR_REVERT] If none of these particular conditions apply, the cities will ask for or demand independence. They may request full independence or assume Vassal status.[PARAGRAPH:2]If you face civil war, the situation may become qui

te dier. Strong garrisons may be able to maintain some semblance of control in some of the revolting cities, but weaker garrisons may be run out of town and the revolutionaries will take the city. Your homeland will not be the same for generations if you face multiple revolting cities on the battlefield! In addition, rebellious cities that the rebels have not yet taken may turn out rebel reinforcements.[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]The Revolution Watch[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]Clicking on the red fist button below the normal info buttons or pressing [BOLD]Ctrl-Shift-W[\BOLD] in the game will open the Revolution Watch popup. This popup displays which of your cities is in danger of rebelling, thinking about rebelling, or happy with your empire. In each category, the cities are ordered with the most rebellious towards the top. In addition, cities whose local situation is deterioirating are shown in orange. For specific information on how your civ-wide policies or the local city situation are effecting the rebelliousness of the city, scroll down and click the details button. This will open a new popup containing a lot of important information about the rebelliousness of your cities.[PARAGRAPH:2]At the top of this detail popup is an analysis of your national policies and situation. The effect of your civics, anarchy, golden age, empire size and fiscal situation are shown here. These affect all of your cities equally. Next is a city by city listing of local effects. The location of the city, the religions and cultures in the city, the happiness and healthiness of the people, the size of the city, the size of the city's garrison, and culture rate are all important factors you may see here. For both positive and negative effects the specific causes are ordered with the strongest first and grayscale indicating the intensity with whiter being more intense.[PARAGRAPH:2]Your civics can have a significant effect on how these local factors are felt. For example, running a theocracy will cause cities with non-state religions to be more rebellious, but keep cities with your state religion less rebellious. Representative government civics will greatly decrease the effects of distance on outlieing cities or colonies.</English>

Other nearby cities with rev indices over 600 can join in a revolution. If a city is unhappy, things are very similar but the minimum threshold for a revolution drops quickly with the number of unhappy citizens. There are several different Revolution styles and the situation in the Revolution instigating city determines the style. Many styles have peaceful and violent variants: denying a request will just agitate the city further, but denying a demand will lead to civil war![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In order of precedence:[NEWLINE][TAB][COLOR_HIGHLIGHT_TEXT]Return to or reform dominant culture:[COLOR_REVERT] Cities in which you don't have a majority culture will become increasing aggitated and may attempt to break away for cultural reasons. The instigator and nearby, similarly cultured cities will ask (peaceful) or demand (violent) to join or reform a dead rival. Denying this request will cause your relations with the rival to deteriorate, and they may choose to declare war![NEWLINE][TAB][COLOR_HIGHLIGHT_TEXT]Religious differences:[COLOR_REVERT]  Cities may ask for a change away from Theocracy or to Freedom of Religion, or to switch your state religion. They can also ask or demand independence for religious reasons.[NEWLINE][TAB][COLOR_HIGHLIGHT_TEXT]Homeland revolutions:[COLOR_REVERT] Ask for various different civics. May ask for you to go on a crusade to capture your religion's holy city.[NEWLINE][TAB][COLOR_HIGHLIGHT_TEXT]Colonial revolutions:[COLOR_REVERT] Ask for change to representative government. (Independence handled below)[NEWLINE][TAB][COLOR_HIGHLIGHT_TEXT]Capital or majority of cities revolting:[COLOR_REVERT] Cities will ask for changes in away from repressive civics, or for some form of a say in the government. They can also ask or demand a change in ruler! If you're running a representative government, accepting their requests will mean facing election. If you are replaced, the game will automate some number of turns and then return control to you (this feature can be disabled). [NEWLINE][TAB][COLOR_HIGHLIGHT_TEXT]Independence:[COLOR_REVERT] If none of these particular conditions apply, the cities will ask for or demand independence. They may request full independence or assume Vassal status.[PARAGRAPH:2]If you face civil war, the situation may become qui

te dier. Strong garrisons may be able to maintain some semblance of control in some of the revolting cities, but weaker garrisons may be run out of town and the revolutionaries will take the city. Your homeland will not be the same for generations if you face multiple revolting cities on the battlefield! In addition, rebellious cities that the rebels have not yet taken may turn out rebel reinforcements.[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]The Revolution Watch[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]Clicking on the red fist button below the normal info buttons or pressing [BOLD]Ctrl-Shift-W[\BOLD] in the game will open the Revolution Watch popup. This popup displays which of your cities is in danger of rebelling, thinking about rebelling, or happy with your empire. In each category, the cities are ordered with the most rebellious towards the top. In addition, cities whose local situation is deterioirating are shown in orange. For specific information on how your civ-wide policies or the local city situation are effecting the rebelliousness of the city, scroll down and click the details button. This will open a new popup containing a lot of important information about the rebelliousness of your cities.[PARAGRAPH:2]At the top of this detail popup is an analysis of your national policies and situation. The effect of your civics, anarchy, golden age, empire size and fiscal situation are shown here. These affect all of your cities equally. Next is a city by city listing of local effects. The location of the city, the religions and cultures in the city, the happiness and healthiness of the people, the size of the city, the size of the city's garrison, and culture rate are all important factors you may see here. For both positive and negative effects the specific causes are ordered with the strongest first and grayscale indicating the intensity with whiter being more intense.[PARAGRAPH:2]Your civics can have a significant effect on how these local factors are felt. For example, running a theocracy will cause cities with non-state religions to be more rebellious, but keep cities with your state religion less rebellious. Representative government civics will greatly decrease the effects of distance on outlieing cities or colonies.</Spanish>

Starting with version 2.0, barb cities first become single city minor civs. These city states can't conduct diplomacy, so they're at war with everyone. When the new civ accomplishes something notable, a leader emerges and the civ settles down into a full civ. These accomplishments can include conquest, reaching a high population, reaching a high level of culture, building wonders, etc. [PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]More details:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]The decision to have a barbarian city form a minor civ is based on the population and culture of the city, whether there are nearby civs, and whether the city was captured. When a minor civ forms, they take control of this single city and are given some units and techs to get started. Since they are a minor civ they're at war with everyone else and cannot conduct diplomacy, so you won't see them on the scoreboard. [PARAGRAPH:2]Each turn the minor civs are checked to see if they deserve to be upgraded to full civ status. When settling down into a full civ, these minor civs will take on one of two types: militaristic and builder. If they have conquered a city, they will immediately settle into a full, militaristic civ and continue the war against whomever they took a city from. If they have reached a high level of culture or built a wonder, they will settle as builders. If they settle due to high population or founding a religion, they have a probabilistic chance of being one or the other. [PARAGRAPH:2]The civs get several bonuses depending on whether they're militaristic or builder. Both types get a base set of defensive units and workers, plus some free techs known to a majority of the world. The new civ also gets a great person (to symbolize the leader who organized the horde), with the GP type depending on the type of consolidation. Their capital is given walls and a granary. If the cities have some culture, the new civ gets half of the total. These general effects for both types of rise of the barbs are intended to partly catch them up with the rest of the world. [PARAGRAPH:2]Militaristic consolidation is the most exciting in my view. It's intended to mimic the effect of Ghengis Khan or the Vikings. There are four different flavors of militaristic settling, Viking, Chariot, Horse, and balanced. Vikings get boats and mostly melee units, Chariot style is for earlier barb settling and they get chariots and some axes, Horse style is mostly Horse archers or Knights if late enough, while balanced gets an assortment of units. The strength of the military is fairly random, and increases as the eras go by. Odds of a militaristic build up increase if the new leader is Aggressive or Expansionist. Militaristic new civs will be behind in economic or social technology. They also get free barracks. Militaristic barbs have a good chance of getting a Great General when spawned. [PARAGRAPH:2]Builder consolidation is intended to mimic the rise of a new civ that isn't particularly militaristic. This type of civ gets additional techs, one or two of which they may be the first to research. They are given a Great Person and may build a wonder or discover a new tech. It's not uncommon for them to found a new religion. They are also given a bunch of extra infrastructure: extra worker, free settler, and some buildings like libraries, lighthouses, and forges (if they have the tech).[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Notes on use:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]To make this component more exciting, the amount of Barbarian activity has generally been increased.

e fun one to play is start a large world with only a handful of civs, then let the barbarians fill in the gaps. Be prepared for a potential invasion from a rising power! BarbarianCiv also works quite well with the Revolution component that can spawn barbarian rebels. [PARAGRAPH:2]On Terra maps, the new world will probably not be as empty as before. A new config variable, NewWorldPolicy, can be used to define how barb cities on their own continent behave so that you can customize how the new world will appear when the first explorers land. Options range from having it mostly full of civs to keeping barb cities as barbarian until someone starts colonizing.[PARAGRAPH:2]There are many other settings in the Revolution.ini config file, including MilitaryStrength which can be used to create massive military invasions and modifiers for controlling the odds of civ formation.</English>

		<Spanish>[H1]BarbarianCiv[\H1][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]The goal:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]In this mod, barbarian cities, if left to their own devices, will eventually settle down into full blown civs![PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]How it works:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]Barbarian cities will settle down probabilistically, with several factor determining the odds. Starting with version 2.0, barb cities first become single city minor civs. These city states can't conduct diplomacy, so they're at war with everyone. When the new civ accomplishes something notable, a leader emerges and the civ settles down into a full civ. These accomplishments can include conquest, reaching a high population, reaching a high level of culture, building wonders, etc. [PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]More details:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]The decision to have a barbarian city form a minor civ is based on the population and culture of the city, whether there are nearby civs, and whether the city was captured. When a minor civ forms, they take control of this single city and are given some units and techs to get started. Since they are a minor civ they're at war with everyone else and cannot conduct diplomacy, so you won't see them on the scoreboard. [PARAGRAPH:2]Each turn the minor civs are checked to see if they deserve to be upgraded to full civ status. When settling down into a full civ, these minor civs will take on one of two types: militaristic and builder. If they have conquered a city, they will immediately settle into a full, militaristic civ and continue the war against whomever they took a city from. If they have reached a high level of culture or built a wonder, they will settle as builders. If they settle due to high population or founding a religion, they have a probabilistic chance of being one or the other. [PARAGRAPH:2]The civs get several bonuses depending on whether they're militaristic or builder. Both types get a base set of defensive units and workers, plus some free techs known to a majority of the world. The new civ also gets a great person (to symbolize the leader who organized the horde), with the GP type depending on the type of consolidation. Their capital is given walls and a granary. If the cities have some culture, the new civ gets half of the total. These general effects for both types of rise of the barbs are intended to partly catch them up with the rest of the world. [PARAGRAPH:2]Militaristic consolidation is the most exciting in my view. It's intended to mimic the effect of Ghengis Khan or the Vikings. There are four different flavors of militaristic settling, Viking, Chariot, Horse, and balanced. Vikings get boats and mostly melee units, Chariot style is for earlier barb settling and they get chariots and some axes, Horse style is mostly Horse archers or Knights if late enough, while balanced gets an assortment of units. The strength of the military is fairly random, and increases as the eras go by. Odds of a militaristic build up increase if the new leader is Aggressive or Expansionist. Militaristic new civs will be behind in economic or social technology. They also get free barracks. Militaristic barbs have a good chance of getting a Great General when spawned. [PARAGRAPH:2]Builder consolidation is intended to mimic the rise of a new civ that isn't particularly militaristic. This type of civ gets additional techs, one or two of which they may be the first to research. They are given a Great Person and may build a wonder or discover a new tech. It's not uncommon for them to found a new religion. They are also given a bunch of extra infrastructure: extra worker, free settler, and some buildings like libraries, lighthouses, and forges (if they have the tech).[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Notes on use:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]To make this component more exciting, the amount of Barbarian activity has generally been increased. Particularly, barbarian cities will form both earlier and more often to help this component fill in empty space in the game map with new players. With this change, a full standard map game will probably see a handful of barb civs emerge. [PARAGRAPH:2]On

e fun one to play is start a large world with only a handful of civs, then let the barbarians fill in the gaps. Be prepared for a potential invasion from a rising power! BarbarianCiv also works quite well with the Revolution component that can spawn barbarian rebels. [PARAGRAPH:2]On Terra maps, the new world will probably not be as empty as before. A new config variable, NewWorldPolicy, can be used to define how barb cities on their own continent behave so that you can customize how the new world will appear when the first explorers land. Options range from having it mostly full of civs to keeping barb cities as barbarian until someone starts colonizing.[PARAGRAPH:2]There are many other settings in the Revolution.ini config file, including MilitaryStrength which can be used to create massive military invasions and modifiers for controlling the odds of civ formation.</Spanish>

The future era has been made common for all artstyles. In some cases you'll still see the normal ingame cityset buildings, which means I haven't found art for those spots or I intended it to remain there. Also, for some units and buildings new .dds files are included which I felt made them look better without altering the basic model of it.[PARAGRAPH:2]Besides citystyles, new facility art has been included for the different artstyles. This part is not finished yet since there's no art available for some artstyles/era's. Included are Sepamu92's fishingboat modcomponent and art has been replaced for some improvements too.[PARAGRAPH:2]The new artstyles in this mod so far are AFRICA, ANGLO AMERICA, ARABIA, ASIA, BARBARIAN, CRESCENT, EGYPT, EUROPE, GRECO_ROMAN, IBERIA, INDIA, JAPAN, MESO AMERICA, MONGOLIA, NATIVE AMERICA, NORSE, RUSSIA, SOUTH AMERICA and SOUTH-EAST ASIA. Don't expect truly different citystyles in all cases tho, quite a number of them are hybrids, especially the Indian -and Khmer civ. The main new thing is that from the Industrial era on a mix of old and new city buildings are used.

		<English>[H1]Influence Driven War[\H1][NEWLINE]by Moctezuma[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Combat influence[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]Military units affect surroundings via combat influence:[PARAGRAPH:2]After each combat between two units: some amount of culture accumulated in each square of combat area is transferred from loser player/AI to winner player/AI. Combat area (i.e. influence radius) is: attacker plot, defended plot and near surrounding plots (see definition of influence radius bellow). Note: This way I try to simulate effect of battle victory: some peoples have tendency to give up and flip to victorious side.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Rules:[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]It works for both field battle and city assault.[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]It works for both attacking and defending (also city defending).[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]If last defending unit in city dies: combat influence is increased greatly (an emergency militia may be "auto-drafted", check new resistance rules later).[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]If victorious unit has warlord: combat influence is increased.[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]If attacking unit withdraws:  no culture transfer happens.[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Calculated culture exchange cannot be higher than loser's remaining culture in plot. This means that no culture transfer happens in empty neutral territory: nobody is living there to be influenced. In third-party territory a culture transfer occurs only if some loser's culture is accumulated there.[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]It works also for attacking/defending barbarians in player or barbarian territory (this can be disabled via XML file).[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Also water squares are affected by combat influence.[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Naval combats use same influence rules as land combats. Note: if naval battle occurs near land, also land squares are affected (naval influence can be disabled via XML file).[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]No culture is exchanged during city bombardment (via catapults, ships, bombers, ICBM); during fighter interception; or if worker/settler is captured out of city.[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Active city resistance[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]If last defending unit in the city dies and city resistance is sufficient then one militia unit emerges in city, otherwise it is captured just like in vanilla. Resistance is sufficient if defender's culture in central plot is same or higher than attacker's culture in central plot (culture ratios in central city plot you can check also in the city screen). Note: This new rule tries to simulate active people resistance in highly cultured cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Militia unit is "auto-drafted":[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Best available regular unit type is selected using same rules as for standard drafting: i.e. warrior, axeman, maceman, musketman, rifleman...[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Auto-drafted unit begins with 25% health (configurable in XML). This represents very low training level of quickly gathered militia.[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Draft anger is 50% of standard draft anger: high danger means low anger. (configurable in XML)[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]City population is reduced by 1 (it doesn't depend on unit type).[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Auto-draft is not limited like standard draft: new militia unit is "auto-drafted" when previous one dies and resistance is still sufficient.[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]When city population is reduced to 1, the city is captured even if resistance is still sufficient.[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]There is no technology requirement for auto-draft: this is not real conscription: imagine peoples that are just trying in defend their homes.[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]It takes some time to accumulate sufficient culture: if city is attacked early no militia emerges.[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Pillage influence[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]When enemy unit pillages tile improvement, some amount of accumulated culture is transferred from improvement owner to unit owner. Only single square is affected. [PARAGRAPH:2]Note: This rule was added to provide incentive for defender to defend own territory and

 not only stay inside cities. It reflects situation where farmers, miners or villagers escape due to farm, mine or village is burned down by invader. [PARAGRAPH:2]This rule is optional and can be disabled via XML.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Rules:[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]It works only in enemy territory (no influence in friendly or neutral territory)[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]No influence form route pillage (roads, railroads).[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Works also for sea improvements (e.g. fishing boats).[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]For improvements like towns, each downgrade influences given square.[PARAGRAPH:2][H1]Gameplay[\H1][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Player is informed about effects of IDW this way:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]After each battle a number with influence % (i.e. exchanged culture ratio) is shown in the game log. It is calculated in defended plot only, but whole combat area is influenced. Reason that I'm using defended plot here is because it is in most cases the most important one (e.g. central city square).[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Green color means culture increase for you[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Red color means culture decrease for you.[PARAGRAPH:2]When last city defender dies and militia unit is "auto-drafted" a remaining resistance % is shown in the game log.[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Result of changes on gameplay:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]1. More dynamic borders during wars:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]In vanilla game a culture plays significant role only in the beginning. In later stages the borders are almost fixed: big changes happen only if cities are captured. [PARAGRAPH:2]With new rules you can fight for territory between cities and not only for cities itself. I think that this "frontline" effect really improves gameplay. You can "win" quite large area with several resources even without conquering single enemy city! Possible tactics if you dont have sufficient power to conquer cities could be stay/pillage/heal near your borders and influence squares by killing approaching enemies.[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]2. Surprise or backstabbing attacks are less effective:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]Attacked city can for short time defend itself even if last defender dies if resistance is sufficient: this increases reaction time for defending player if he has many units in the opposite side of empire.[PARAGRAPH:2]However you cannot count on auto-drafted units. These are meant only to slow-down attack in case when everything else fails. In most cases a militia units can defend high cultured city only 1-2 turns until real defender units arrive because: [NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Militia unit begins with very low health, so if it is attacked in same turn, it almost certainly dies.[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]City resistance decreases very quickly because victory influence is much higher when last city defender dies (see NoCityDefenderMultiplier).[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Each auto-drafted unit increases unhappiness in the city.[PARAGRAPH:2]Note: I cannot make militia units more effective, because then player can abuse it: e.g. move out all defenders from city and later counterattack damaged attackers.[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]3. High cultured cities are harder to conquer (more militia formed) but easier to hold after capture [\BOLD]because city's central square has quite good amount of conquerors culture immediately after capture.[PARAGRAPH:2]This means:[PARAGRAPH:2]No problem with cultural flipping of captured city back to original owner: In vanilla is this problem is fixed by disabling startup option: "City flipping after conquest". This is no longer needed in this mod.[PARAGRAPH:2]Much smaller problem with cultural flipping of captured city to neighbor civ, which can be in peace with conqueror. Naturally, if just conquered city has been in big cultural pressure prior to capture it will be in pressure also after it, because culture is transferred only from city's previous owner.[PARAGRAPH:2]Note: culture buildings in newly captured city are still very important because city still begins with zero culture (only plots are influenced by combat).[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]4.

 No problems with stealing of conquered city:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]This happens often in multiplayer with simultaneous turns but sometimes it occurs  also in single-player: Two players are doing joint attack on same enemy city; first  player destroys all defenders; second one just waits until last defender remains there and then attacks.[PARAGRAPH:2]With new rules the city capture is fairer: culture in central city square is increased after each victory for each attacking player separately. If no defender unit is left then attacker, whose culture in central square is higher than owners culture, captures the city.[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]5. In battles quality counts more than quantity:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]With new rules the conquest is easier with smaller stack of high strength units than with bigger stack of low strength units: Veteran unit makes more influence (see UnitExperienceMultiplier) and better victory/loss ratio means more culture transferred to attacker.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Some examples:[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Suicide catapults are little less effective: due to losses, defender's culture increases more often.[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Blitz units like tanks are very effective: due to multiple culture exchanges per turn. This really speeds up the conquest of very highly cultured cities in later stages of game, which can be really slow otherwise.[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Warlord units are more effective than normal units (see WarlordMultiplier).</English>

		<English>[H1]Better BTS AI[\H1][NEWLINE]v0.78
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]New User Interface Features[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]Holding down SHIFT+ALT and clicking on a leader in the scoreboard toggles your civ's warplan between WARPLAN_PREPARING_TOTAL and NO_WARPLAN.  This feature can be used to signal to your vassals that they should begin preparing for war with a particular player as well, allowing them to be much better prepared when you declare.  Any warning you can give your vassals will help, but enough time to build one to two units in a city is best.  WARNING: Use of this feature is not multiplayer compatible, WARPLANs are not sent across the network since they're otherwise only used by the AI and so it will lead to OOS errors if you have vassals.[PARAGRAPH:2]The scoreboard will show WAR in yellow instead of red when you have declared you are planning a war using the above feature.[PARAGRAPH:2]Added line to contact help text explaining that SHIFT+ALT clicking toggles war preparation plans.[PARAGRAPH:2]Air units can now be set to explore, they use the same explore logic as AI planes and then have additional logic if that doesn't push a mission.  Note that planes on auto explore always move at the very beginning of your turn!
		[PARAGRAPH:2]Better BTS AI is a mod component which improves AI behaviour:
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]War Strategy AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Modified how closeness is used for determining who to attack, different setting for regular and aggressive AI
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will consider declaring war for resources, weighted towards resources AI doesn't have and plots that are more easily capture
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Modified city attack targeting by terrain bonuses to consider how important bonus is to AI
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]An AI winning a war no longer automatically accepts offers of capitulation, may continue conquest under a few circumstances
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AIs will no longer declare war on faraway vassals of their neighbors
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]If team is losing a land war badly, they will now use defensive area AI in all areas where there is significant enemy presence
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Modified a losing civs decision to offer capitulation, prior method made capitulation less likely if there were many small capitulated vassals on the map
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Adjusted threshold for offering capitulation based on above change
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI now begins accelerating war plan if it has 1.5x as much power as enemy, instead of only accelerating at higher than 2.0x
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]War tactics AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Attack city stacks will now reduce the distance they travel in enemy territory so the enemy has less time to prepare or hit them with suicide siege
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Attack stacks with decent initial odds and big troop advantage will skip bombarding and just attack (so enemy can't restock)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Attack stacks without much bombard power will now prefer to go after cities with low defense modifiers, effect reduced after AI can build bombers
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Attack stacks without much bombard power are a little bolder in attacking city before defenses are lowered to 0, though they will bombard a few turns to make sure bombers and ships can get some shots in
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Loaded transports coming in for an invasion will now usually move outside opponents territory and adjacent tiles to up surprise factor and reduce exposure to attacks before landing
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now beef up border security a little before a war (as if it has terrible relations with neighbor), not enough to give intentions away
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI now treats a border with a vassal as pretty safe, regardless of relations
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now prefer to stage attack stacks in coastal cities with transports when running invasion for faster loading into boats
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Created new logic for AI to run assault transports to reinforce its existing positions without building up new full invasion force
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI can now time smaller transport loads to arrive at the same time as bigger invasion stacks
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Attack city stacks in own cities now wait if enough units are just about to join before heading off to attack
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI puts less weight on minor civ cities when also at war with major civs
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Vassal AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Vassals will now be better prepared to participate when their AI master is planning a war.  If their master is a human, they will be probabilistically be a bit better prepared.
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Capitulated vassals will now build health improvements more often in cities which need them to help break the population barrier to freedom
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Capitulated vassals will now build culture improvements in more cities with low culture ratings to try to snag more territory and gain their freedom
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]City AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now more likely fill empty transports when enagaged in transcontinental war, making reinforcements and second waves on invasions more likely
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]When doing invasions, AI will now be more likely to have cities with free air experience fill vacancies on carriers
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]When doing invasions, AI will now have cities with high production or free sea experience more often fill needs for aircraft carriers
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]When doing invasions, if AI has at least 50% of its possible missile capacity it will no longer always build missiles
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Rewrote CvCityAI::AI_isAirDefended so that it considers unit damage, movement, AI type and can also count land units
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Normal workboat build blocked if there's an enemy sea unit camping outside city
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Coastal cities will now build boats as if planning a sea invasion if there is no route to enemy cities
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Improved handling of building troops to fill transports, unified between coastal and non-coastal cities
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Non-coastal cities now help fill carriers, missile carriers
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]The AI was blocked from building attack troops if it felt it was unable to build good ones, now if it is at war it can build them but with low probability so it can fight back a little early in the game
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now emergency build fighter planes if its air defenses are shot down but it still has lots of bombers and missiles
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]If not critical, AI will let cities with high production or free air experience usually build most planes
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Cities with military production bonuses now a bit more likely to build military units
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now always build some assault transports if it has significant overseas colonies to help defend them
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now build reserve sea units to defend its settler transports in later eras
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Reduced construction of escorts that are weaker than the transports they would be escorting (Caravels escorting Galleons primarily)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI coastal cities will now act as if running AREAAI_ASSAULT (ie, doing invasion) if team has war plan against a team it can't reach, not just at war
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Blocked coastal cities from gearing up for naval invasions if enemy team isn't on same water area (for cities on inland lakes in maps with oceans)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI cities on inland lakes which are connected through a bridge city to the ocean are now considered to be on "relevant" water areas, meaning they will now help build navies
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Tweaked logic for production of escorts so the AI builds them faster if it doesn't have any
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Adjusted threshold for construction of missionaries when at war, an AI that is on a roll capturing cities will now be more likely to build missionaries to convert the new cities
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Added extra logic for panic production of defensive and counter attack units when AI is losing the wars it is in
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will no longer build Galley settler or troop transports when it has access to Carracks or some other transport which can enter ocean tiles (half of fix for Galley->Carrack->Galleon issues)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Fix for issue with selection of plots to work which led to tiny per turn production in some large coastal cities due to higher weighting on food.  Particularly an issue with coastal cities whose only hammer access is forested plains.  AI coastal cities will now produce at least a few hammers when they have enough food.
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Production of planes for carriers now happens when AI has empty carriers, independent of whether AI is launch invasion.  Should better fill carriers built outside of invasion logic which were often useless before
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Worker AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Fix issue where AI would not build workboats to make use of resources in small lakes (was blocked because it felt lake was not relevant militarily)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Fixed issue where AI workers would load into a galley with a settler, causing a defenseless settler to freze on empty island
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Fixed issue where AI workers responded strongly to temporary commerce/research emphasis decisions (one cause of cottage cycling down)
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Settler AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Fixed bug where settlers with no path to city sites on same continent would idle indefinitely and never load on transports
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Transports will now only unload settlers who actually have a path to city sites in area
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI now has extra encouragement to put cities on water when water access is not ice locked, when ocean is militarily relevant, and if player doesn't have enough coastal cities yet
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI now has extra encouragement to put cities on rivers early in the game
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Transport full with a settler and workers but no defense now dumps the load, no longer delivers the sitting ducks to remote island/new world alone
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Settler transports which have a settler on board no longer look for other settler to pick up, now explicitly look for extra city defense units (only one settler will load anyway, chasing additional settlers was just a waste of time before)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will not send out new colonists when it is already in financial trouble
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Espionage AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]When a spy has waited in a city but has no mission available, they are now more likely to move around and explore instead of sitting
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Revamped desired Espionage rate and priority weighting calculations, AI now always update weights, relations play a larger role
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Neutral priority weighting is now 10 instead of 0, differentiates between 
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]When AI starts preparing for war against another player they will heavily shift their espionage spending towards that player
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will attempt to gain passive mission levels against adversaries
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now actually load spies onto the spy transport it builds
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Smoothed and rebalanced AI's weighting on espionage yield, previously was either equal to production (!) or 0.  This issue caused the overemphasis on spy specialists by governors.
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]City govenor weighting of espionage yield now responsive to player's positioning of espionage slider
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Gold AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI now has a budget for troop upgrades each turn based on how much gold it wants to have, it won't spend more than this budget on non-critical units when at peace
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI now prioritizes upgrading escort ships to same extent as transports
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Tweaks so that AI emphasizes/deemphasizes gold yield in a broader range of circumstances, will help AI and city governors make better choices when doing all out science or culture and also if having money problems.
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Civic AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI now will more readily change civics in a golden age, acts as if it is spiritual
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Diplomacy AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Removed blanket acceptance of all proposals by secretaries the AI is friends with, now just auto accept less strategic proposals like extra trade routes
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Being friends with secretary now influences civics and other strategic proposals
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI now more likely to defy civic proposals which are bad for it, particularly on Aggressive AI
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Reworked AI voting on forced peace, added thresholds so winning/losing calculations are more meaningful (no longer losing a war in which no units have fought, unless being dogpiled)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]For forced peace proposals, added considerations for whether peace team is winning or losing big
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AIs which are third parties to the war in question may now vote to continue it for selfish reasons (share wars with peace team, are planning to attack peace team)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now only defy forced peace if it is doing quite well in the war, increased use of personality so warmongers are much more likely to defy
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Vassals will now vote for forced war proposal under some circustances.  Previously they were blocked from voting for a war they weren't already in since they can't declare war on their own.  (Vassals of player to be attacked always vote no still)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now always vote for a forced war proposal against a player they are planning to attack anyway in addition to always voting yes if already at war
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]For forced war vote, replaced blanket check on whether AI doesn't hate victim with roll based on AI's attitude-based peace probability
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Averaging of attitudes of vassals and masters is now done using the more accurate +- attitude value, not the attitude type
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Naval AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Modified bombard behavior. Priority remains on supporting player's ground troops, if none then consider supporting other troops with common enemy and spreading out stacks to increase reach of blockade.
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Modified and expanded Solver's changes to retreat from city/fort AI to be more specialized for various unit AI types, only move if there's a real threat
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Increased city danger threshold so enemy ships do not runaway so easily
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Damaged ships will stay unless city is highly threatened
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Galleons assigned escort roles before Frigates are available will now change their UnitAI type to assault transport instead of getting stuck in their role after better escorts come along
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Transport ships waiting in port will now only unload their cargo during a land war if an enemy city can be reached by land, the player is on the defensive locally, or a stack of enemy units shows up.  Increases naval invasions of distant enemies on Pangea maps, sea assaults to complement land assaults.
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Assault flotillas now leave behind empty transports
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Assault ships now assume cities whose defenses the player can't see are properly defended (previously counted as a single defender). Should make invasions more likely to occur near blockades, attack ships, prior invasions.
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now try to break blockades if it has many attack ships in port
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Transports will now pickup units stranded on small islands
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Transports looking for cargo to pickup now use PUF_isAvailableGroupHeadUnitAIType instead of just counting unit ai types, should stop assault transports from waiting forever for units attached to a settler to load or waiting forever on small islands for units already in their cargo to load
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]EscortAI units will now also shadow settler_sea units when there is nothing else to do
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Added a pathlength consideration to AI_pickup so that mostly loaded flotillas don't sail around the world to pickup one more unit (previously they would have waited trying to load the units they already had on board until someone else came around)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]SettlerSea transports now only run pickup if they're not full (another change necessary since transports no longer try to pickup the units they're already holding)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Modified CvUnitAI::AI_shadow to optionally ignore units in cities, far away
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Reserve sea units will now prioritize shadowing settler transports out at sea even if they're empty
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Attack sea units won't run around the world to shadow transports and carriers
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Slow escorts (Caravels mainly) will now protect large flotillas instead of doing nothing
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Escorts with nothing to do will now return to the primary area if it's not too far away so that primary area city production decisions take them into consideration
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]If a settler transport is full of workers but has nowhere to take them, it will now dump the cargo if an available settler comes along
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Assault transports at sea will now wait for escorts, other transports etc that are about to join them
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Assault transports that aren't full but have enough units for an invasion will now wait one more turn if there are units about to load onboard or group with them
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Improved grouping of AI transports, two groups with multiple transports each can now group together to form one big enough to invade (previously transports could only join a group one at a time, two groups could never merge while carrying cargo or being escorted)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI transports looking for attack city stacks to pick up now require cities to only have at least one dedicated defender, improves AIs ability to pickup troops from prior invasions and island hop
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Assault transports in port now wait for nearby escorts to arrive before launching invasions
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now transfer some troops to the new world to conquer barbarian cities if it isn't doing anything else with them
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Reinforcement sized invasions will also now hunt barb cities if civ has no war plans
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Settler, spy and missionary transports that are not full and but have units coming to load now explicitly wait for them instead of going to do pickups somewhere else
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Changes to CvUnitAI::AI_retreatToCity to stop oscillation of naval units into and out of threatened cities
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Assault transports with cargo no longer move to cities to pickup units which are still being produced (reduces exposure to poaching), won't consider units which were just built in between turns either
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Transports which launch an amphibious invasion will now also drop-off any units which remain on board after the invasion (due to winning combat, seige units) in the captured city instead of transporting them back
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Transports no longer attempt to pickup attack city units recovering in recently captured cities
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Second waves of invasions will now more likely target areas where AI already has captured some cities
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI transports now scrap or switch UNITAI type if owner can build better transports but unit can't upgrade to them (half of fix for Galley->Carrack->Galleon issues)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI ocean-capable transport groups now split off galleys
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI galley assault transports which can upgrade now wait in cities to be upgraded
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Air AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Modified and expanded Solver's changes to retreat from city/fort AI to be more specialized for various unit AI types, only move if there's a real threat
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Increased city danger threshold so enemy aircraft do not retreat so easily
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Attack planes in endangered cities will now more likely to airstrike attackers
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Improved code for defense planes in endangered cities so they stay to defend longer and either airstrike or patrol
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Improved efficiency of danger threshold check for ships and planes
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Improved code for moving planes to offensive or defensive bases to take city threat into account
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI bombers will no longer consider basing in undefended forts even if the fort is unthreatened
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI bombers will now consider moving to a city with two defenders (down from requiring 3), change made because of added threat logic and should allow AI to now use almost all of its cities as airbases
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Fixed bug introduced in Unofficial Patch 0.19 causing bombers to skip their turns whenever an interceptor was around
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Many improvements to better handle damaged planes in threatened cities
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Added two functions for defensive airstrikes to make both air defense and offense units more directly aid in defending cities from enemy stacks
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI air defense units wake from airpatrol every turn, re-decide roles/need
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI air defense units now consider how many other air defense units there are in the city and guarantee air defense
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Air defense units with Interceptor promotions now will be more likely to patrol when city is threatened
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Added new function for weighting bases for attack air units with new consideration for supporting offensive stacks and defending endangered cities, plus keeping planes safe from sneak attacks when at peace
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]When at war forts are now more likely to be used as offensive bases, though cities are still preferred
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will again consider basing attack planes in teammate's territory (plot defense considerations effectively disabled this in many circumstances in earlier versions of mod)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now consider basing attack planes in vassal territory, though it will only use them if it owns no good base cities or forts itself
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Attack air units will now pull out of cities/forts if the defenders leave
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Airstrikes will no longer target enemies in adjacent territory when the territory is only adjacent to owned water tiles
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Fighters now always move before bombers, they're much better at taking on enemy fighters
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]New function in CvPlot to count how many air units are running intercept missions already
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Added emphasis for both offensive and defensive units on the the players primary area
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]If nearby enemies have no attack aircraft, fewer units are needed for air defense (freeing up fighters to make air strikes).  Only applies to players the AI is actually at war with, so their sneak attack preparations remain the same.
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Unit AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will skip bombarding and go straight to attacking cities when it has good initial attack odds and a big strength advantage
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Stranded units with nothing to do will wait once someone is coming to get them instead of mindlessly patrolling
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Stranded settlers will now wait if someone is coming to get them instead of just scrapping after 20 turns
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Attack unit stacks will now break up when assigned to defend workers so that some of the units can do other things (protect other workers, get in transports)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Units set to UNITAI_ATTACK will now get in transports instead of aimlessly patrolling when player is preparing invasion force
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]If attack_city units cannot reach an enemy city while in land war, they will try airlifts and then load into boats
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Tweaked circumstances where attack units load into transports to encourage filling up boats
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Fixed discrepancy where attack units could group with settlers and then get in boats but were highly unlikely to get in boats with waiting settlers
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Speed up to AI_group so it loops over selection groups instead of units
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Attack units now do a bit better of defending cities in the new world if the AI hasn't sent/built enough city defense units yet
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Removed blanket block for loading transports when in land war, now handled by specific unit ai logic
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Tweaked loading of Counter units (Axemen, etc) onto boats to integrate with other changes
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Removed redundant logic from counter ai routine
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]If an attack city stack is not big enough to go out on its own, but has enough units coming to join it, it will wait instead of traveling a long way to join another forming stack
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Added new flags to AI_group to allow grouping only with transports which are full, in port
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Great people, missionaries, executives now avoid or won't move through enemy territory when running their missions
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Catch several cases where unit deaths can cause strange groupings
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Large groups no longer run choke mission, will go for attacks instead
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Attack city stacks will now wait for units just about to join them
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will no longer send missionaries, execs, most great people through enemy territory
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI great generals now strongly avoid traveling in enemy territory when joining units
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Transports will now avoid grouping with those that have different impassability counts (galley vs galleon)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Lowered AI preference for fast UNITAI_ATTACK units (knights, cavalry) when they're not the strongest attackers
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Barbarian AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Barbarian ships will now often blockade cities for a few turns before moving on if they have no nearby targets
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Barb ships trapped by ice or around 1-tile islands are now removed so more can spawn
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Barb ship spawn rate throttled so they don't swamp the seas before players build navies
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Improved barb ship blockade decisions so they stick around for a while but will then should actually move to another area
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Barb ships less suicidal, more oppurtunistic
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Reduced range in which barb ships detect unprotected resources by 25%
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Barbarians now will build defenders in captured cities first, not buildings
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Barb cities now wait to build workers until pop 2
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Barb player no longer feels like it's in financial trouble, meaning it won't spam cottages around it cities or build banks on Terra maps
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Lowered barb players weight on science and gold commerce, so that it rarely builds these types of buildings
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Pirate AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Privateers now prefer moving outside of other teams territory and enter at the last moment for a quick strike
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Fixed issue with AI Privateers being unable to group, also won't run around the whole world just to group
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Cultural Victory AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]If AI moves its capital, it will no longer always block pursuit of cultural victory
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Further boosted AI's valuation of culture yield for second, third place culture city when going for cultural victory 
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]The AI's final city for cultural victory will now build culture much more frequently, tightening up their vcitory
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]General AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Modified city closeness calculations to use population from both cities, not just pop of the other city
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Created functions for determining when cities share the same water area (lake, ocean)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Removed the unused partial implementation of a new A* solver for closeness
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]A bonus which enables the civ's unique unit is now valued more

		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now be reluctant to sacrifice units with medic promotions when assaulting a well-defended city
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Created function PUF_isUnitAITypeGroupee, PUF_isAvailableUnitAITypeGroupee for counting number of unit ai's on a plot in a group of a particular AI type which might actually load onto a transport (aren't already cargo)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Created two path finding flags to weight paths towards avoiding enemy territory, useful for minimizing exposure of attack stacks, loaded transports, or privateers to enemy attack
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Created function to approximate how long it will take for a stack to bombard city defenses to 0
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Added new version of CvPlayerAI::AI_unitTargetMissionAIs which counts how many unit target mission AIs are within a certain range (for detecting units wanting to load on transports)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Added function PUF_isFiniteRangeAndNotJustProduced to allow counting of units who have had at least one turn of their own to move
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Units using path flags MOVE_AVOID_ENEMY_WEIGHT_x now will also try to end each turn not in/adjacent to enemy territory when possible, used by AI transports to there's less likely to be a turn of exposure before invasion
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Added CvSelectionGroup::canMoveAllTerrain to fix issue with all terrain transports in mods
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Added CvSelectionGroupAI::AI_seperateLimitedTransports to fix issue with AI using stacks of mixed galley and galleon transports
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now avoid building invisible escorts since they cannot defend
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Combat Mechanics[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Modification for air v air combat to make veteran units more valuable, especially when wounded.  Air v air combat is now more much more similar to land combat.  This change can be disabled/enabled using BBAI_AIR_COMBAT in GlobalDefinesAlt.xml</English>
		<French>[H1]Better BTS AI[\H1][NEWLINE]v0.78
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]New User Interface Features[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]Holding down SHIFT+ALT and clicking on a leader in the scoreboard toggles your civ's warplan between WARPLAN_PREPARING_TOTAL and NO_WARPLAN.  This feature can be used to signal to your vassals that they should begin preparing for war with a particular player as well, allowing them to be much better prepared when you declare.  Any warning you can give your vassals will help, but enough time to build one to two units in a city is best.  WARNING: Use of this feature is not multiplayer compatible, WARPLANs are not sent across the network since they're otherwise only used by the AI and so it will lead to OOS errors if you have vassals.[PARAGRAPH:2]The scoreboard will show WAR in yellow instead of red when you have declared you are planning a war using the above feature.[PARAGRAPH:2]Added line to contact help text explaining that SHIFT+ALT clicking toggles war preparation plans.[PARAGRAPH:2]Air units can now be set to explore, they use the same explore logic as AI planes and then have additional logic if that doesn't push a mission.  Note that planes on auto explore always move at the very beginning of your turn!
		[PARAGRAPH:2]Better BTS AI is a mod component which improves AI behaviour:
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]War Strategy AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Modified how closeness is used for determining who to attack, different setting for regular and aggressive AI
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will consider declaring war for resources, weighted towards resources AI doesn't have and plots that are more easily capture
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Modified city attack targeting by terrain bonuses to consider how important bonus is to AI
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]An AI winning a war no longer automatically accepts offers of capitulation, may continue conquest under a few circumstances
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AIs will no longer declare war on faraway vassals of their neighbors
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]If team is losing a land war badly, they will now use defensive area AI in all areas where there is significant enemy presence
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Modified a losing civs decision to offer capitulation, prior method made capitulation less likely if there were many small capitulated vassals on the map
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Adjusted threshold for offering capitulation based on above change
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI now begins accelerating war plan if it has 1.5x as much power as enemy, instead of only accelerating at higher than 2.0x
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]War tactics AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Attack city stacks will now reduce the distance they travel in enemy territory so the enemy has less time to prepare or hit them with suicide siege
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Attack stacks with decent initial odds and big troop advantage will skip bombarding and just attack (so enemy can't restock)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Attack stacks without much bombard power will now prefer to go after cities with low defense modifiers, effect reduced after AI can build bombers
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Attack stacks without much bombard power are a little bolder in attacking city before defenses are lowered to 0, though they will bombard a few turns to make sure bombers and ships can get some shots in
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Loaded transports coming in for an invasion will now usually move outside opponents territory and adjacent tiles to up surprise factor and reduce exposure to attacks before landing
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now beef up border security a little before a war (as if it has terrible relations with neighbor), not enough to give intentions away
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI now treats a border with a vassal as pretty safe, regardless of relations
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now prefer to stage attack stacks in coastal cities with transports when running invasion for faster loading into boats
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Created new logic for AI to run assault transports to reinforce its existing positions without building up new full invasion force
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI can now time smaller transport loads to arrive at the same time as bigger invasion stacks
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Attack city stacks in own cities now wait if enough units are just about to join before heading off to attack
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI puts less weight on minor civ cities when also at war with major civs
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Vassal AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Vassals will now be better prepared to participate when their AI master is planning a war.  If their master is a human, they will be probabilistically be a bit better prepared.
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Capitulated vassals will now build health improvements more often in cities which need them to help break the population barrier to freedom
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Capitulated vassals will now build culture improvements in more cities with low culture ratings to try to snag more territory and gain their freedom
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]City AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now more likely fill empty transports when enagaged in transcontinental war, making reinforcements and second waves on invasions more likely
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]When doing invasions, AI will now be more likely to have cities with free air experience fill vacancies on carriers
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]When doing invasions, AI will now have cities with high production or free sea experience more often fill needs for aircraft carriers
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]When doing invasions, if AI has at least 50% of its possible missile capacity it will no longer always build missiles
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Rewrote CvCityAI::AI_isAirDefended so that it considers unit damage, movement, AI type and can also count land units
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Normal workboat build blocked if there's an enemy sea unit camping outside city
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Coastal cities will now build boats as if planning a sea invasion if there is no route to enemy cities
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Improved handling of building troops to fill transports, unified between coastal and non-coastal cities
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Non-coastal cities now help fill carriers, missile carriers
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]The AI was blocked from building attack troops if it felt it was unable to build good ones, now if it is at war it can build them but with low probability so it can fight back a little early in the game
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now emergency build fighter planes if its air defenses are shot down but it still has lots of bombers and missiles
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]If not critical, AI will let cities with high production or free air experience usually build most planes
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Cities with military production bonuses now a bit more likely to build military units
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now always build some assault transports if it has significant overseas colonies to help defend them
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now build reserve sea units to defend its settler transports in later eras
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Reduced construction of escorts that are weaker than the transports they would be escorting (Caravels escorting Galleons primarily)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI coastal cities will now act as if running AREAAI_ASSAULT (ie, doing invasion) if team has war plan against a team it can't reach, not just at war
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Blocked coastal cities from gearing up for naval invasions if enemy team isn't on same water area (for cities on inland lakes in maps with oceans)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI cities on inland lakes which are connected through a bridge city to the ocean are now considered to be on "relevant" water areas, meaning they will now help build navies
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Tweaked logic for production of escorts so the AI builds them faster if it doesn't have any
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Adjusted threshold for construction of missionaries when at war, an AI that is on a roll capturing cities will now be more likely to build missionaries to convert the new cities
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Added extra logic for panic production of defensive and counter attack units when AI is losing the wars it is in
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will no longer build Galley settler or troop transports when it has access to Carracks or some other transport which can enter ocean tiles (half of fix for Galley->Carrack->Galleon issues)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Fix for issue with selection of plots to work which led to tiny per turn production in some large coastal cities due to higher weighting on food.  Particularly an issue with coastal cities whose only hammer access is forested plains.  AI coastal cities will now produce at least a few hammers when they have enough food.
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Production of planes for carriers now happens when AI has empty carriers, independent of whether AI is launch invasion.  Should better fill carriers built outside of invasion logic which were often useless before
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Worker AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Fix issue where AI would not build workboats to make use of resources in small lakes (was blocked because it felt lake was not relevant militarily)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Fixed issue where AI workers would load into a galley with a settler, causing a defenseless settler to freze on empty island
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Fixed issue where AI workers responded strongly to temporary commerce/research emphasis decisions (one cause of cottage cycling down)
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Settler AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Fixed bug where settlers with no path to city sites on same continent would idle indefinitely and never load on transports
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Transports will now only unload settlers who actually have a path to city sites in area
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI now has extra encouragement to put cities on water when water access is not ice locked, when ocean is militarily relevant, and if player doesn't have enough coastal cities yet
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI now has extra encouragement to put cities on rivers early in the game
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Transport full with a settler and workers but no defense now dumps the load, no longer delivers the sitting ducks to remote island/new world alone
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Settler transports which have a settler on board no longer look for other settler to pick up, now explicitly look for extra city defense units (only one settler will load anyway, chasing additional settlers was just a waste of time before)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will not send out new colonists when it is already in financial trouble
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Espionage AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]When a spy has waited in a city but has no mission available, they are now more likely to move around and explore instead of sitting
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Revamped desired Espionage rate and priority weighting calculations, AI now always update weights, relations play a larger role
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Neutral priority weighting is now 10 instead of 0, differentiates between 
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]When AI starts preparing for war against another player they will heavily shift their espionage spending towards that player
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will attempt to gain passive mission levels against adversaries
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now actually load spies onto the spy transport it builds
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Smoothed and rebalanced AI's weighting on espionage yield, previously was either equal to production (!) or 0.  This issue caused the overemphasis on spy specialists by governors.
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]City govenor weighting of espionage yield now responsive to player's positioning of espionage slider
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Gold AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI now has a budget for troop upgrades each turn based on how much gold it wants to have, it won't spend more than this budget on non-critical units when at peace
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI now prioritizes upgrading escort ships to same extent as transports
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Tweaks so that AI emphasizes/deemphasizes gold yield in a broader range of circumstances, will help AI and city governors make better choices when doing all out science or culture and also if having money problems.
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Civic AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI now will more readily change civics in a golden age, acts as if it is spiritual
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Diplomacy AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Removed blanket acceptance of all proposals by secretaries the AI is friends with, now just auto accept less strategic proposals like extra trade routes
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Being friends with secretary now influences civics and other strategic proposals
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI now more likely to defy civic proposals which are bad for it, particularly on Aggressive AI
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Reworked AI voting on forced peace, added thresholds so winning/losing calculations are more meaningful (no longer losing a war in which no units have fought, unless being dogpiled)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]For forced peace proposals, added considerations for whether peace team is winning or losing big
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AIs which are third parties to the war in question may now vote to continue it for selfish reasons (share wars with peace team, are planning to attack peace team)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now only defy forced peace if it is doing quite well in the war, increased use of personality so warmongers are much more likely to defy
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Vassals will now vote for forced war proposal under some circustances.  Previously they were blocked from voting for a war they weren't already in since they can't declare war on their own.  (Vassals of player to be attacked always vote no still)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now always vote for a forced war proposal against a player they are planning to attack anyway in addition to always voting yes if already at war
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]For forced war vote, replaced blanket check on whether AI doesn't hate victim with roll based on AI's attitude-based peace probability
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Averaging of attitudes of vassals and masters is now done using the more accurate +- attitude value, not the attitude type
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Naval AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Modified bombard behavior. Priority remains on supporting player's ground troops, if none then consider supporting other troops with common enemy and spreading out stacks to increase reach of blockade.
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Modified and expanded Solver's changes to retreat from city/fort AI to be more specialized for various unit AI types, only move if there's a real threat
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Increased city danger threshold so enemy ships do not runaway so easily
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Damaged ships will stay unless city is highly threatened
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Galleons assigned escort roles before Frigates are available will now change their UnitAI type to assault transport instead of getting stuck in their role after better escorts come along
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Transport ships waiting in port will now only unload their cargo during a land war if an enemy city can be reached by land, the player is on the defensive locally, or a stack of enemy units shows up.  Increases naval invasions of distant enemies on Pangea maps, sea assaults to complement land assaults.
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Assault flotillas now leave behind empty transports
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Assault ships now assume cities whose defenses the player can't see are properly defended (previously counted as a single defender). Should make invasions more likely to occur near blockades, attack ships, prior invasions.
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now try to break blockades if it has many attack ships in port
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Transports will now pickup units stranded on small islands
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Transports looking for cargo to pickup now use PUF_isAvailableGroupHeadUnitAIType instead of just counting unit ai types, should stop assault transports from waiting forever for units attached to a settler to load or waiting forever on small islands for units already in their cargo to load
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]EscortAI units will now also shadow settler_sea units when there is nothing else to do
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Added a pathlength consideration to AI_pickup so that mostly loaded flotillas don't sail around the world to pickup one more unit (previously they would have waited trying to load the units they already had on board until someone else came around)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]SettlerSea transports now only run pickup if they're not full (another change necessary since transports no longer try to pickup the units they're already holding)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Modified CvUnitAI::AI_shadow to optionally ignore units in cities, far away
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Reserve sea units will now prioritize shadowing settler transports out at sea even if they're empty
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Attack sea units won't run around the world to shadow transports and carriers
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Slow escorts (Caravels mainly) will now protect large flotillas instead of doing nothing
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Escorts with nothing to do will now return to the primary area if it's not too far away so that primary area city production decisions take them into consideration
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]If a settler transport is full of workers but has nowhere to take them, it will now dump the cargo if an available settler comes along
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Assault transports at sea will now wait for escorts, other transports etc that are about to join them
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Assault transports that aren't full but have enough units for an invasion will now wait one more turn if there are units about to load onboard or group with them
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Improved grouping of AI transports, two groups with multiple transports each can now group together to form one big enough to invade (previously transports could only join a group one at a time, two groups could never merge while carrying cargo or being escorted)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI transports looking for attack city stacks to pick up now require cities to only have at least one dedicated defender, improves AIs ability to pickup troops from prior invasions and island hop
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Assault transports in port now wait for nearby escorts to arrive before launching invasions
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now transfer some troops to the new world to conquer barbarian cities if it isn't doing anything else with them
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Reinforcement sized invasions will also now hunt barb cities if civ has no war plans
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Settler, spy and missionary transports that are not full and but have units coming to load now explicitly wait for them instead of going to do pickups somewhere else
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Changes to CvUnitAI::AI_retreatToCity to stop oscillation of naval units into and out of threatened cities
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Assault transports with cargo no longer move to cities to pickup units which are still being produced (reduces exposure to poaching), won't consider units which were just built in between turns either
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Transports which launch an amphibious invasion will now also drop-off any units which remain on board after the invasion (due to winning combat, seige units) in the captured city instead of transporting them back
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Transports no longer attempt to pickup attack city units recovering in recently captured cities
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Second waves of invasions will now more likely target areas where AI already has captured some cities
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI transports now scrap or switch UNITAI type if owner can build better transports but unit can't upgrade to them (half of fix for Galley->Carrack->Galleon issues)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI ocean-capable transport groups now split off galleys
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI galley assault transports which can upgrade now wait in cities to be upgraded
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Air AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Modified and expanded Solver's changes to retreat from city/fort AI to be more specialized for various unit AI types, only move if there's a real threat
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Increased city danger threshold so enemy aircraft do not retreat so easily
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Attack planes in endangered cities will now more likely to airstrike attackers
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Improved code for defense planes in endangered cities so they stay to defend longer and either airstrike or patrol
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Improved efficiency of danger threshold check for ships and planes
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Improved code for moving planes to offensive or defensive bases to take city threat into account
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI bombers will no longer consider basing in undefended forts even if the fort is unthreatened
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI bombers will now consider moving to a city with two defenders (down from requiring 3), change made because of added threat logic and should allow AI to now use almost all of its cities as airbases
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Fixed bug introduced in Unofficial Patch 0.19 causing bombers to skip their turns whenever an interceptor was around
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Many improvements to better handle damaged planes in threatened cities
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Added two functions for defensive airstrikes to make both air defense and offense units more directly aid in defending cities from enemy stacks
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI air defense units wake from airpatrol every turn, re-decide roles/need
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI air defense units now consider how many other air defense units there are in the city and guarantee air defense
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Air defense units with Interceptor promotions now will be more likely to patrol when city is threatened
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Added new function for weighting bases for attack air units with new consideration for supporting offensive stacks and defending endangered cities, plus keeping planes safe from sneak attacks when at peace
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]When at war forts are now more likely to be used as offensive bases, though cities are still preferred
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will again consider basing attack planes in teammate's territory (plot defense considerations effectively disabled this in many circumstances in earlier versions of mod)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now consider basing attack planes in vassal territory, though it will only use them if it owns no good base cities or forts itself
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Attack air units will now pull out of cities/forts if the defenders leave
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Airstrikes will no longer target enemies in adjacent territory when the territory is only adjacent to owned water tiles
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Fighters now always move before bombers, they're much better at taking on enemy fighters
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]New function in CvPlot to count how many air units are running intercept missions already
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Added emphasis for both offensive and defensive units on the the players primary area
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]If nearby enemies have no attack aircraft, fewer units are needed for air defense (freeing up fighters to make air strikes).  Only applies to players the AI is actually at war with, so their sneak attack preparations remain the same.
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Unit AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will skip bombarding and go straight to attacking cities when it has good initial attack odds and a big strength advantage
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Stranded units with nothing to do will wait once someone is coming to get them instead of mindlessly patrolling
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Stranded settlers will now wait if someone is coming to get them instead of just scrapping after 20 turns
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Attack unit stacks will now break up when assigned to defend workers so that some of the units can do other things (protect other workers, get in transports)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Units set to UNITAI_ATTACK will now get in transports instead of aimlessly patrolling when player is preparing invasion force
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]If attack_city units cannot reach an enemy city while in land war, they will try airlifts and then load into boats
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Tweaked circumstances where attack units load into transports to encourage filling up boats
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Fixed discrepancy where attack units could group with settlers and then get in boats but were highly unlikely to get in boats with waiting settlers
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Speed up to AI_group so it loops over selection groups instead of units
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Attack units now do a bit better of defending cities in the new world if the AI hasn't sent/built enough city defense units yet

		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Tweaked loading of Counter units (Axemen, etc) onto boats to integrate with other changes
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Removed redundant logic from counter ai routine
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]If an attack city stack is not big enough to go out on its own, but has enough units coming to join it, it will wait instead of traveling a long way to join another forming stack
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Added new flags to AI_group to allow grouping only with transports which are full, in port
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Great people, missionaries, executives now avoid or won't move through enemy territory when running their missions
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Catch several cases where unit deaths can cause strange groupings

		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will no longer send missionaries, execs, most great people through enemy territory
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI great generals now strongly avoid traveling in enemy territory when joining units
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Transports will now avoid grouping with those that have different impassability counts (galley vs galleon)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Lowered AI preference for fast UNITAI_ATTACK units (knights, cavalry) when they're not the strongest attackers
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Barbarian AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Barbarian ships will now often blockade cities for a few turns before moving on if they have no nearby targets
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Barb ships trapped by ice or around 1-tile islands are now removed so more can spawn
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Barb ship spawn rate throttled so they don't swamp the seas before players build navies
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Improved barb ship blockade decisions so they stick around for a while but will then should actually move to another area
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Barb ships less suicidal, more oppurtunistic
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Reduced range in which barb ships detect unprotected resources by 25%
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Barbarians now will build defenders in captured cities first, not buildings
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Barb cities now wait to build workers until pop 2
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Barb player no longer feels like it's in financial trouble, meaning it won't spam cottages around it cities or build banks on Terra maps
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Lowered barb players weight on science and gold commerce, so that it rarely builds these types of buildings
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Pirate AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Privateers now prefer moving outside of other teams territory and enter at the last moment for a quick strike
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Fixed issue with AI Privateers being unable to group, also won't run around the whole world just to group
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Cultural Victory AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]If AI moves its capital, it will no longer always block pursuit of cultural victory
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Further boosted AI's valuation of culture yield for second, third place culture city when going for cultural victory 
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]The AI's final city for cultural victory will now build culture much more frequently, tightening up their vcitory
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]General AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Modified city closeness calculations to use population from both cities, not just pop of the other city
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Created functions for determining when cities share the same water area (lake, ocean)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Removed the unused partial implementation of a new A* solver for closeness
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]A bonus which enables the civ's unique unit is now valued more

		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now be more likely to sacrifice green units when assaulting a well-defended city
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now be reluctant to sacrifice units with medic promotions when assaulting a well-defended city
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Created function PUF_isUnitAITypeGroupee, PUF_isAvailableUnitAITypeGroupee for counting number of unit ai's on a plot in a group of a particular AI type which might actually load onto a transport (aren't already cargo)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Created two path finding flags to weight paths towards avoiding enemy territory, useful for minimizing exposure of attack stacks, loaded transports, or privateers to enemy attack
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Created function to approximate how long it will take for a stack to bombard city defenses to 0
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Added new version of CvPlayerAI::AI_unitTargetMissionAIs which counts how many unit target mission AIs are within a certain range (for detecting units wanting to load on transports)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Added function PUF_isFiniteRangeAndNotJustProduced to allow counting of units who have had at least one turn of their own to move
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Units using path flags MOVE_AVOID_ENEMY_WEIGHT_x now will also try to end each turn not in/adjacent to enemy territory when possible, used by AI transports to there's less likely to be a turn of exposure before invasion
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Added CvSelectionGroup::canMoveAllTerrain to fix issue with all terrain transports in mods
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Added CvSelectionGroupAI::AI_seperateLimitedTransports to fix issue with AI using stacks of mixed galley and galleon transports
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now avoid building invisible escorts since they cannot defend
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Combat Mechanics[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Modification for air v air combat to make veteran units more valuable, especially when wounded.  Air v air combat is now more much more similar to land combat.  This change can be disabled/enabled using BBAI_AIR_COMBAT in GlobalDefinesAlt.xml</French>
		<German>[H1]Better BTS AI[\H1][NEWLINE]v0.78
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]New User Interface Features[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]Holding down SHIFT+ALT and clicking on a leader in the scoreboard toggles your civ's warplan between WARPLAN_PREPARING_TOTAL and NO_WARPLAN.  This feature can be used to signal to your vassals that they should begin preparing for war with a particular player as well, allowing them to be much better prepared when you declare.  Any warning you can give your vassals will help, but enough time to build one to two units in a city is best.  WARNING: Use of this feature is not multiplayer compatible, WARPLANs are not sent across the network since they're otherwise only used by the AI and so it will lead to OOS errors if you have vassals.[PARAGRAPH:2]The scoreboard will show WAR in yellow instead of red when you have declared you are planning a war using the above feature.[PARAGRAPH:2]Added line to contact help text explaining that SHIFT+ALT clicking toggles war preparation plans.[PARAGRAPH:2]Air units can now be set to explore, they use the same explore logic as AI planes and then have additional logic if that doesn't push a mission.  Note that planes on auto explore always move at the very beginning of your turn!
		[PARAGRAPH:2]Better BTS AI is a mod component which improves AI behaviour:
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]War Strategy AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Modified how closeness is used for determining who to attack, different setting for regular and aggressive AI
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will consider declaring war for resources, weighted towards resources AI doesn't have and plots that are more easily capture
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Modified city attack targeting by terrain bonuses to consider how important bonus is to AI
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]An AI winning a war no longer automatically accepts offers of capitulation, may continue conquest under a few circumstances
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AIs will no longer declare war on faraway vassals of their neighbors
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]If team is losing a land war badly, they will now use defensive area AI in all areas where there is significant enemy presence
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Modified a losing civs decision to offer capitulation, prior method made capitulation less likely if there were many small capitulated vassals on the map
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Adjusted threshold for offering capitulation based on above change
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI now begins accelerating war plan if it has 1.5x as much power as enemy, instead of only accelerating at higher than 2.0x
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]War tactics AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Attack city stacks will now reduce the distance they travel in enemy territory so the enemy has less time to prepare or hit them with suicide siege
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Attack stacks with decent initial odds and big troop advantage will skip bombarding and just attack (so enemy can't restock)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Attack stacks without much bombard power will now prefer to go after cities with low defense modifiers, effect reduced after AI can build bombers
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Attack stacks without much bombard power are a little bolder in attacking city before defenses are lowered to 0, though they will bombard a few turns to make sure bombers and ships can get some shots in
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Loaded transports coming in for an invasion will now usually move outside opponents territory and adjacent tiles to up surprise factor and reduce exposure to attacks before landing
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now beef up border security a little before a war (as if it has terrible relations with neighbor), not enough to give intentions away
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI now treats a border with a vassal as pretty safe, regardless of relations
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now prefer to stage attack stacks in coastal cities with transports when running invasion for faster loading into boats
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Created new logic for AI to run assault transports to reinforce its existing positions without building up new full invasion force
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI can now time smaller transport loads to arrive at the same time as bigger invasion stacks
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Attack city stacks in own cities now wait if enough units are just about to join before heading off to attack
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI puts less weight on minor civ cities when also at war with major civs
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Vassal AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Vassals will now be better prepared to participate when their AI master is planning a war.  If their master is a human, they will be probabilistically be a bit better prepared.
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Capitulated vassals will now build health improvements more often in cities which need them to help break the population barrier to freedom
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Capitulated vassals will now build culture improvements in more cities with low culture ratings to try to snag more territory and gain their freedom
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]City AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now more likely fill empty transports when enagaged in transcontinental war, making reinforcements and second waves on invasions more likely
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]When doing invasions, AI will now be more likely to have cities with free air experience fill vacancies on carriers
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]When doing invasions, AI will now have cities with high production or free sea experience more often fill needs for aircraft carriers
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]When doing invasions, if AI has at least 50% of its possible missile capacity it will no longer always build missiles
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Rewrote CvCityAI::AI_isAirDefended so that it considers unit damage, movement, AI type and can also count land units
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Normal workboat build blocked if there's an enemy sea unit camping outside city
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Coastal cities will now build boats as if planning a sea invasion if there is no route to enemy cities
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Improved handling of building troops to fill transports, unified between coastal and non-coastal cities
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Non-coastal cities now help fill carriers, missile carriers
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]The AI was blocked from building attack troops if it felt it was unable to build good ones, now if it is at war it can build them but with low probability so it can fight back a little early in the game
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now emergency build fighter planes if its air defenses are shot down but it still has lots of bombers and missiles
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]If not critical, AI will let cities with high production or free air experience usually build most planes
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Cities with military production bonuses now a bit more likely to build military units
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now always build some assault transports if it has significant overseas colonies to help defend them
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now build reserve sea units to defend its settler transports in later eras
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Reduced construction of escorts that are weaker than the transports they would be escorting (Caravels escorting Galleons primarily)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI coastal cities will now act as if running AREAAI_ASSAULT (ie, doing invasion) if team has war plan against a team it can't reach, not just at war
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Blocked coastal cities from gearing up for naval invasions if enemy team isn't on same water area (for cities on inland lakes in maps with oceans)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI cities on inland lakes which are connected through a bridge city to the ocean are now considered to be on "relevant" water areas, meaning they will now help build navies
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Tweaked logic for production of escorts so the AI builds them faster if it doesn't have any
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Adjusted threshold for construction of missionaries when at war, an AI that is on a roll capturing cities will now be more likely to build missionaries to convert the new cities
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Added extra logic for panic production of defensive and counter attack units when AI is losing the wars it is in
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will no longer build Galley settler or troop transports when it has access to Carracks or some other transport which can enter ocean tiles (half of fix for Galley->Carrack->Galleon issues)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Fix for issue with selection of plots to work which led to tiny per turn production in some large coastal cities due to higher weighting on food.  Particularly an issue with coastal cities whose only hammer access is forested plains.  AI coastal cities will now produce at least a few hammers when they have enough food.
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Production of planes for carriers now happens when AI has empty carriers, independent of whether AI is launch invasion.  Should better fill carriers built outside of invasion logic which were often useless before
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Worker AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Fix issue where AI would not build workboats to make use of resources in small lakes (was blocked because it felt lake was not relevant militarily)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Fixed issue where AI workers would load into a galley with a settler, causing a defenseless settler to freze on empty island
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Fixed issue where AI workers responded strongly to temporary commerce/research emphasis decisions (one cause of cottage cycling down)
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Settler AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Fixed bug where settlers with no path to city sites on same continent would idle indefinitely and never load on transports
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Transports will now only unload settlers who actually have a path to city sites in area
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI now has extra encouragement to put cities on water when water access is not ice locked, when ocean is militarily relevant, and if player doesn't have enough coastal cities yet
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI now has extra encouragement to put cities on rivers early in the game
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Transport full with a settler and workers but no defense now dumps the load, no longer delivers the sitting ducks to remote island/new world alone
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Settler transports which have a settler on board no longer look for other settler to pick up, now explicitly look for extra city defense units (only one settler will load anyway, chasing additional settlers was just a waste of time before)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will not send out new colonists when it is already in financial trouble
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Espionage AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]When a spy has waited in a city but has no mission available, they are now more likely to move around and explore instead of sitting
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Revamped desired Espionage rate and priority weighting calculations, AI now always update weights, relations play a larger role
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Neutral priority weighting is now 10 instead of 0, differentiates between 
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]When AI starts preparing for war against another player they will heavily shift their espionage spending towards that player
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will attempt to gain passive mission levels against adversaries
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now actually load spies onto the spy transport it builds
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Smoothed and rebalanced AI's weighting on espionage yield, previously was either equal to production (!) or 0.  This issue caused the overemphasis on spy specialists by governors.
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]City govenor weighting of espionage yield now responsive to player's positioning of espionage slider
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Gold AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI now has a budget for troop upgrades each turn based on how much gold it wants to have, it won't spend more than this budget on non-critical units when at peace
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI now prioritizes upgrading escort ships to same extent as transports
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Tweaks so that AI emphasizes/deemphasizes gold yield in a broader range of circumstances, will help AI and city governors make better choices when doing all out science or culture and also if having money problems.
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Civic AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI now will more readily change civics in a golden age, acts as if it is spiritual
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Diplomacy AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Removed blanket acceptance of all proposals by secretaries the AI is friends with, now just auto accept less strategic proposals like extra trade routes
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Being friends with secretary now influences civics and other strategic proposals
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI now more likely to defy civic proposals which are bad for it, particularly on Aggressive AI
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Reworked AI voting on forced peace, added thresholds so winning/losing calculations are more meaningful (no longer losing a war in which no units have fought, unless being dogpiled)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]For forced peace proposals, added considerations for whether peace team is winning or losing big
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AIs which are third parties to the war in question may now vote to continue it for selfish reasons (share wars with peace team, are planning to attack peace team)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now only defy forced peace if it is doing quite well in the war, increased use of personality so warmongers are much more likely to defy
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Vassals will now vote for forced war proposal under some circustances.  Previously they were blocked from voting for a war they weren't already in since they can't declare war on their own.  (Vassals of player to be attacked always vote no still)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now always vote for a forced war proposal against a player they are planning to attack anyway in addition to always voting yes if already at war
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]For forced war vote, replaced blanket check on whether AI doesn't hate victim with roll based on AI's attitude-based peace probability
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Averaging of attitudes of vassals and masters is now done using the more accurate +- attitude value, not the attitude type
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Naval AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Modified bombard behavior. Priority remains on supporting player's ground troops, if none then consider supporting other troops with common enemy and spreading out stacks to increase reach of blockade.
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Modified and expanded Solver's changes to retreat from city/fort AI to be more specialized for various unit AI types, only move if there's a real threat
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Increased city danger threshold so enemy ships do not runaway so easily
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Damaged ships will stay unless city is highly threatened
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Galleons assigned escort roles before Frigates are available will now change their UnitAI type to assault transport instead of getting stuck in their role after better escorts come along
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Transport ships waiting in port will now only unload their cargo during a land war if an enemy city can be reached by land, the player is on the defensive locally, or a stack of enemy units shows up.  Increases naval invasions of distant enemies on Pangea maps, sea assaults to complement land assaults.
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Assault flotillas now leave behind empty transports
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Assault ships now assume cities whose defenses the player can't see are properly defended (previously counted as a single defender). Should make invasions more likely to occur near blockades, attack ships, prior invasions.
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now try to break blockades if it has many attack ships in port
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Transports will now pickup units stranded on small islands
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Transports looking for cargo to pickup now use PUF_isAvailableGroupHeadUnitAIType instead of just counting unit ai types, should stop assault transports from waiting forever for units attached to a settler to load or waiting forever on small islands for units already in their cargo to load
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]EscortAI units will now also shadow settler_sea units when there is nothing else to do
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Added a pathlength consideration to AI_pickup so that mostly loaded flotillas don't sail around the world to pickup one more unit (previously they would have waited trying to load the units they already had on board until someone else came around)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]SettlerSea transports now only run pickup if they're not full (another change necessary since transports no longer try to pickup the units they're already holding)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Modified CvUnitAI::AI_shadow to optionally ignore units in cities, far away
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Reserve sea units will now prioritize shadowing settler transports out at sea even if they're empty
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Attack sea units won't run around the world to shadow transports and carriers
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Slow escorts (Caravels mainly) will now protect large flotillas instead of doing nothing
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Escorts with nothing to do will now return to the primary area if it's not too far away so that primary area city production decisions take them into consideration
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]If a settler transport is full of workers but has nowhere to take them, it will now dump the cargo if an available settler comes along
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Assault transports at sea will now wait for escorts, other transports etc that are about to join them
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Assault transports that aren't full but have enough units for an invasion will now wait one more turn if there are units about to load onboard or group with them
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Improved grouping of AI transports, two groups with multiple transports each can now group together to form one big enough to invade (previously transports could only join a group one at a time, two groups could never merge while carrying cargo or being escorted)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI transports looking for attack city stacks to pick up now require cities to only have at least one dedicated defender, improves AIs ability to pickup troops from prior invasions and island hop
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Assault transports in port now wait for nearby escorts to arrive before launching invasions
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now transfer some troops to the new world to conquer barbarian cities if it isn't doing anything else with them
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Reinforcement sized invasions will also now hunt barb cities if civ has no war plans
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Settler, spy and missionary transports that are not full and but have units coming to load now explicitly wait for them instead of going to do pickups somewhere else
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Changes to CvUnitAI::AI_retreatToCity to stop oscillation of naval units into and out of threatened cities
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Assault transports with cargo no longer move to cities to pickup units which are still being produced (reduces exposure to poaching), won't consider units which were just built in between turns either
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Transports which launch an amphibious invasion will now also drop-off any units which remain on board after the invasion (due to winning combat, seige units) in the captured city instead of transporting them back
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Transports no longer attempt to pickup attack city units recovering in recently captured cities
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Second waves of invasions will now more likely target areas where AI already has captured some cities
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI transports now scrap or switch UNITAI type if owner can build better transports but unit can't upgrade to them (half of fix for Galley->Carrack->Galleon issues)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI ocean-capable transport groups now split off galleys
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI galley assault transports which can upgrade now wait in cities to be upgraded
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Air AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Modified and expanded Solver's changes to retreat from city/fort AI to be more specialized for various unit AI types, only move if there's a real threat
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Increased city danger threshold so enemy aircraft do not retreat so easily
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Attack planes in endangered cities will now more likely to airstrike attackers
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Improved code for defense planes in endangered cities so they stay to defend longer and either airstrike or patrol

		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Improved code for moving planes to offensive or defensive bases to take city threat into account
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI bombers will no longer consider basing in undefended forts even if the fort is unthreatened
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI bombers will now consider moving to a city with two defenders (down from requiring 3), change made because of added threat logic and should allow AI to now use almost all of its cities as airbases
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Fixed bug introduced in Unofficial Patch 0.19 causing bombers to skip their turns whenever an interceptor was around
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Many improvements to better handle damaged planes in threatened cities
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Added two functions for defensive airstrikes to make both air defense and offense units more directly aid in defending cities from enemy stacks
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI air defense units wake from airpatrol every turn, re-decide roles/need
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI air defense units now consider how many other air defense units there are in the city and guarantee air defense
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Air defense units with Interceptor promotions now will be more likely to patrol when city is threatened
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Added new function for weighting bases for attack air units with new consideration for supporting offensive stacks and defending endangered cities, plus keeping planes safe from sneak attacks when at peace
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]When at war forts are now more likely to be used as offensive bases, though cities are still preferred
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will again consider basing attack planes in teammate's territory (plot defense considerations effectively disabled this in many circumstances in earlier versions of mod)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now consider basing attack planes in vassal territory, though it will only use them if it owns no good base cities or forts itself
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Attack air units will now pull out of cities/forts if the defenders leave
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Airstrikes will no longer target enemies in adjacent territory when the territory is only adjacent to owned water tiles
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Fighters now always move before bombers, they're much better at taking on enemy fighters
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]New function in CvPlot to count how many air units are running intercept missions already
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Added emphasis for both offensive and defensive units on the the players primary area
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]If nearby enemies have no attack aircraft, fewer units are needed for air defense (freeing up fighters to make air strikes).  Only applies to players the AI is actually at war with, so their sneak attack preparations remain the same.
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Unit AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will skip bombarding and go straight to attacking cities when it has good initial attack odds and a big strength advantage
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Stranded units with nothing to do will wait once someone is coming to get them instead of mindlessly patrolling
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Stranded settlers will now wait if someone is coming to get them instead of just scrapping after 20 turns
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Attack unit stacks will now break up when assigned to defend workers so that some of the units can do other things (protect other workers, get in transports)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Units set to UNITAI_ATTACK will now get in transports instead of aimlessly patrolling when player is preparing invasion force
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]If attack_city units cannot reach an enemy city while in land war, they will try airlifts and then load into boats
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Tweaked circumstances where attack units load into transports to encourage filling up boats
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Fixed discrepancy where attack units could group with settlers and then get in boats but were highly unlikely to get in boats with waiting settlers
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Speed up to AI_group so it loops over selection groups instead of units
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Attack units now do a bit better of defending cities in the new world if the AI hasn't sent/built enough city defense units yet

		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Removed redundant logic from counter ai routine
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]If an attack city stack is not big enough to go out on its own, but has enough units coming to join it, it will wait instead of traveling a long way to join another forming stack
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Added new flags to AI_group to allow grouping only with transports which are full, in port
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Great people, missionaries, executives now avoid or won't move through enemy territory when running their missions

		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI great generals now strongly avoid traveling in enemy territory when joining units
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Transports will now avoid grouping with those that have different impassability counts (galley vs galleon)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Lowered AI preference for fast UNITAI_ATTACK units (knights, cavalry) when they're not the strongest attackers
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Barbarian AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Barbarian ships will now often blockade cities for a few turns before moving on if they have no nearby targets
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Barb ships trapped by ice or around 1-tile islands are now removed so more can spawn
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Barb ship spawn rate throttled so they don't swamp the seas before players build navies
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Improved barb ship blockade decisions so they stick around for a while but will then should actually move to another area
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Barb ships less suicidal, more oppurtunistic
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Reduced range in which barb ships detect unprotected resources by 25%
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Barbarians now will build defenders in captured cities first, not buildings
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Barb cities now wait to build workers until pop 2
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Barb player no longer feels like it's in financial trouble, meaning it won't spam cottages around it cities or build banks on Terra maps
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Lowered barb players weight on science and gold commerce, so that it rarely builds these types of buildings
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Pirate AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Privateers now prefer moving outside of other teams territory and enter at the last moment for a quick strike
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Fixed issue with AI Privateers being unable to group, also won't run around the whole world just to group
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Cultural Victory AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]If AI moves its capital, it will no longer always block pursuit of cultural victory
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Further boosted AI's valuation of culture yield for second, third place culture city when going for cultural victory 
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]The AI's final city for cultural victory will now build culture much more frequently, tightening up their vcitory
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]General AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Modified city closeness calculations to use population from both cities, not just pop of the other city
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Created functions for determining when cities share the same water area (lake, ocean)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Removed the unused partial implementation of a new A* solver for closeness
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]A bonus which enables the civ's unique unit is now valued more

		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now be reluctant to sacrifice units with medic promotions when assaulting a well-defended city
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Created function PUF_isUnitAITypeGroupee, PUF_isAvailableUnitAITypeGroupee for counting number of unit ai's on a plot in a group of a particular AI type which might actually load onto a transport (aren't already cargo)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Created two path finding flags to weight paths towards avoiding enemy territory, useful for minimizing exposure of attack stacks, loaded transports, or privateers to enemy attack
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Created function to approximate how long it will take for a stack to bombard city defenses to 0
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Added new version of CvPlayerAI::AI_unitTargetMissionAIs which counts how many unit target mission AIs are within a certain range (for detecting units wanting to load on transports)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Added function PUF_isFiniteRangeAndNotJustProduced to allow counting of units who have had at least one turn of their own to move
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Units using path flags MOVE_AVOID_ENEMY_WEIGHT_x now will also try to end each turn not in/adjacent to enemy territory when possible, used by AI transports to there's less likely to be a turn of exposure before invasion
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Added CvSelectionGroup::canMoveAllTerrain to fix issue with all terrain transports in mods
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Added CvSelectionGroupAI::AI_seperateLimitedTransports to fix issue with AI using stacks of mixed galley and galleon transports
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now avoid building invisible escorts since they cannot defend
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Combat Mechanics[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Modification for air v air combat to make veteran units more valuable, especially when wounded.  Air v air combat is now more much more similar to land combat.  This change can be disabled/enabled using BBAI_AIR_COMBAT in GlobalDefinesAlt.xml</German>
		<Italian>[H1]Better BTS AI[\H1][NEWLINE]v0.78
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]New User Interface Features[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]Holding down SHIFT+ALT and clicking on a leader in the scoreboard toggles your civ's warplan between WARPLAN_PREPARING_TOTAL and NO_WARPLAN.  This feature can be used to signal to your vassals that they should begin preparing for war with a particular player as well, allowing them to be much better prepared when you declare.  Any warning you can give your vassals will help, but enough time to build one to two units in a city is best.  WARNING: Use of this feature is not multiplayer compatible, WARPLANs are not sent across the network since they're otherwise only used by the AI and so it will lead to OOS errors if you have vassals.[PARAGRAPH:2]The scoreboard will show WAR in yellow instead of red when you have declared you are planning a war using the above feature.[PARAGRAPH:2]Added line to contact help text explaining that SHIFT+ALT clicking toggles war preparation plans.[PARAGRAPH:2]Air units can now be set to explore, they use the same explore logic as AI planes and then have additional logic if that doesn't push a mission.  Note that planes on auto explore always move at the very beginning of your turn!
		[PARAGRAPH:2]Better BTS AI is a mod component which improves AI behaviour:
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]War Strategy AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Modified how closeness is used for determining who to attack, different setting for regular and aggressive AI
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will consider declaring war for resources, weighted towards resources AI doesn't have and plots that are more easily capture
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Modified city attack targeting by terrain bonuses to consider how important bonus is to AI
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]An AI winning a war no longer automatically accepts offers of capitulation, may continue conquest under a few circumstances
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AIs will no longer declare war on faraway vassals of their neighbors
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]If team is losing a land war badly, they will now use defensive area AI in all areas where there is significant enemy presence
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Modified a losing civs decision to offer capitulation, prior method made capitulation less likely if there were many small capitulated vassals on the map
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Adjusted threshold for offering capitulation based on above change
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI now begins accelerating war plan if it has 1.5x as much power as enemy, instead of only accelerating at higher than 2.0x
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]War tactics AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Attack city stacks will now reduce the distance they travel in enemy territory so the enemy has less time to prepare or hit them with suicide siege
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Attack stacks with decent initial odds and big troop advantage will skip bombarding and just attack (so enemy can't restock)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Attack stacks without much bombard power will now prefer to go after cities with low defense modifiers, effect reduced after AI can build bombers
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Attack stacks without much bombard power are a little bolder in attacking city before defenses are lowered to 0, though they will bombard a few turns to make sure bombers and ships can get some shots in
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Loaded transports coming in for an invasion will now usually move outside opponents territory and adjacent tiles to up surprise factor and reduce exposure to attacks before landing
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now beef up border security a little before a war (as if it has terrible relations with neighbor), not enough to give intentions away
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI now treats a border with a vassal as pretty safe, regardless of relations
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now prefer to stage attack stacks in coastal cities with transports when running invasion for faster loading into boats
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Created new logic for AI to run assault transports to reinforce its existing positions without building up new full invasion force
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI can now time smaller transport loads to arrive at the same time as bigger invasion stacks
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Attack city stacks in own cities now wait if enough units are just about to join before heading off to attack
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI puts less weight on minor civ cities when also at war with major civs
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Vassal AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Vassals will now be better prepared to participate when their AI master is planning a war.  If their master is a human, they will be probabilistically be a bit better prepared.
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Capitulated vassals will now build health improvements more often in cities which need them to help break the population barrier to freedom
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Capitulated vassals will now build culture improvements in more cities with low culture ratings to try to snag more territory and gain their freedom
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]City AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now more likely fill empty transports when enagaged in transcontinental war, making reinforcements and second waves on invasions more likely
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]When doing invasions, AI will now be more likely to have cities with free air experience fill vacancies on carriers
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]When doing invasions, AI will now have cities with high production or free sea experience more often fill needs for aircraft carriers
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]When doing invasions, if AI has at least 50% of its possible missile capacity it will no longer always build missiles
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Rewrote CvCityAI::AI_isAirDefended so that it considers unit damage, movement, AI type and can also count land units
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Normal workboat build blocked if there's an enemy sea unit camping outside city
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Coastal cities will now build boats as if planning a sea invasion if there is no route to enemy cities
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Improved handling of building troops to fill transports, unified between coastal and non-coastal cities
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Non-coastal cities now help fill carriers, missile carriers
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]The AI was blocked from building attack troops if it felt it was unable to build good ones, now if it is at war it can build them but with low probability so it can fight back a little early in the game
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now emergency build fighter planes if its air defenses are shot down but it still has lots of bombers and missiles
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]If not critical, AI will let cities with high production or free air experience usually build most planes
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Cities with military production bonuses now a bit more likely to build military units
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now always build some assault transports if it has significant overseas colonies to help defend them
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now build reserve sea units to defend its settler transports in later eras
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Reduced construction of escorts that are weaker than the transports they would be escorting (Caravels escorting Galleons primarily)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI coastal cities will now act as if running AREAAI_ASSAULT (ie, doing invasion) if team has war plan against a team it can't reach, not just at war
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Blocked coastal cities from gearing up for naval invasions if enemy team isn't on same water area (for cities on inland lakes in maps with oceans)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI cities on inland lakes which are connected through a bridge city to the ocean are now considered to be on "relevant" water areas, meaning they will now help build navies
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Tweaked logic for production of escorts so the AI builds them faster if it doesn't have any
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Adjusted threshold for construction of missionaries when at war, an AI that is on a roll capturing cities will now be more likely to build missionaries to convert the new cities
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Added extra logic for panic production of defensive and counter attack units when AI is losing the wars it is in
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will no longer build Galley settler or troop transports when it has access to Carracks or some other transport which can enter ocean tiles (half of fix for Galley->Carrack->Galleon issues)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Fix for issue with selection of plots to work which led to tiny per turn production in some large coastal cities due to higher weighting on food.  Particularly an issue with coastal cities whose only hammer access is forested plains.  AI coastal cities will now produce at least a few hammers when they have enough food.
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Production of planes for carriers now happens when AI has empty carriers, independent of whether AI is launch invasion.  Should better fill carriers built outside of invasion logic which were often useless before
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Worker AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Fix issue where AI would not build workboats to make use of resources in small lakes (was blocked because it felt lake was not relevant militarily)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Fixed issue where AI workers would load into a galley with a settler, causing a defenseless settler to freze on empty island
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Fixed issue where AI workers responded strongly to temporary commerce/research emphasis decisions (one cause of cottage cycling down)
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Settler AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Fixed bug where settlers with no path to city sites on same continent would idle indefinitely and never load on transports
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Transports will now only unload settlers who actually have a path to city sites in area
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI now has extra encouragement to put cities on water when water access is not ice locked, when ocean is militarily relevant, and if player doesn't have enough coastal cities yet
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI now has extra encouragement to put cities on rivers early in the game
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Transport full with a settler and workers but no defense now dumps the load, no longer delivers the sitting ducks to remote island/new world alone
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Settler transports which have a settler on board no longer look for other settler to pick up, now explicitly look for extra city defense units (only one settler will load anyway, chasing additional settlers was just a waste of time before)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will not send out new colonists when it is already in financial trouble
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Espionage AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]When a spy has waited in a city but has no mission available, they are now more likely to move around and explore instead of sitting
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Revamped desired Espionage rate and priority weighting calculations, AI now always update weights, relations play a larger role
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Neutral priority weighting is now 10 instead of 0, differentiates between 
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]When AI starts preparing for war against another player they will heavily shift their espionage spending towards that player
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will attempt to gain passive mission levels against adversaries
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now actually load spies onto the spy transport it builds
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Smoothed and rebalanced AI's weighting on espionage yield, previously was either equal to production (!) or 0.  This issue caused the overemphasis on spy specialists by governors.
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]City govenor weighting of espionage yield now responsive to player's positioning of espionage slider
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Gold AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI now has a budget for troop upgrades each turn based on how much gold it wants to have, it won't spend more than this budget on non-critical units when at peace
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI now prioritizes upgrading escort ships to same extent as transports
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Tweaks so that AI emphasizes/deemphasizes gold yield in a broader range of circumstances, will help AI and city governors make better choices when doing all out science or culture and also if having money problems.
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Civic AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI now will more readily change civics in a golden age, acts as if it is spiritual
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Diplomacy AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Removed blanket acceptance of all proposals by secretaries the AI is friends with, now just auto accept less strategic proposals like extra trade routes
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Being friends with secretary now influences civics and other strategic proposals
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI now more likely to defy civic proposals which are bad for it, particularly on Aggressive AI
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Reworked AI voting on forced peace, added thresholds so winning/losing calculations are more meaningful (no longer losing a war in which no units have fought, unless being dogpiled)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]For forced peace proposals, added considerations for whether peace team is winning or losing big
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AIs which are third parties to the war in question may now vote to continue it for selfish reasons (share wars with peace team, are planning to attack peace team)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now only defy forced peace if it is doing quite well in the war, increased use of personality so warmongers are much more likely to defy
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Vassals will now vote for forced war proposal under some circustances.  Previously they were blocked from voting for a war they weren't already in since they can't declare war on their own.  (Vassals of player to be attacked always vote no still)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now always vote for a forced war proposal against a player they are planning to attack anyway in addition to always voting yes if already at war
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]For forced war vote, replaced blanket check on whether AI doesn't hate victim with roll based on AI's attitude-based peace probability
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Averaging of attitudes of vassals and masters is now done using the more accurate +- attitude value, not the attitude type
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Naval AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Modified bombard behavior. Priority remains on supporting player's ground troops, if none then consider supporting other troops with common enemy and spreading out stacks to increase reach of blockade.
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Modified and expanded Solver's changes to retreat from city/fort AI to be more specialized for various unit AI types, only move if there's a real threat
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Increased city danger threshold so enemy ships do not runaway so easily
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Damaged ships will stay unless city is highly threatened
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Galleons assigned escort roles before Frigates are available will now change their UnitAI type to assault transport instead of getting stuck in their role after better escorts come along
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Transport ships waiting in port will now only unload their cargo during a land war if an enemy city can be reached by land, the player is on the defensive locally, or a stack of enemy units shows up.  Increases naval invasions of distant enemies on Pangea maps, sea assaults to complement land assaults.
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Assault flotillas now leave behind empty transports
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Assault ships now assume cities whose defenses the player can't see are properly defended (previously counted as a single defender). Should make invasions more likely to occur near blockades, attack ships, prior invasions.
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now try to break blockades if it has many attack ships in port
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Transports will now pickup units stranded on small islands
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Transports looking for cargo to pickup now use PUF_isAvailableGroupHeadUnitAIType instead of just counting unit ai types, should stop assault transports from waiting forever for units attached to a settler to load or waiting forever on small islands for units already in their cargo to load
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]EscortAI units will now also shadow settler_sea units when there is nothing else to do
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Added a pathlength consideration to AI_pickup so that mostly loaded flotillas don't sail around the world to pickup one more unit (previously they would have waited trying to load the units they already had on board until someone else came around)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]SettlerSea transports now only run pickup if they're not full (another change necessary since transports no longer try to pickup the units they're already holding)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Modified CvUnitAI::AI_shadow to optionally ignore units in cities, far away
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Reserve sea units will now prioritize shadowing settler transports out at sea even if they're empty
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Attack sea units won't run around the world to shadow transports and carriers
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Slow escorts (Caravels mainly) will now protect large flotillas instead of doing nothing
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Escorts with nothing to do will now return to the primary area if it's not too far away so that primary area city production decisions take them into consideration
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]If a settler transport is full of workers but has nowhere to take them, it will now dump the cargo if an available settler comes along
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Assault transports at sea will now wait for escorts, other transports etc that are about to join them
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Assault transports that aren't full but have enough units for an invasion will now wait one more turn if there are units about to load onboard or group with them
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Improved grouping of AI transports, two groups with multiple transports each can now group together to form one big enough to invade (previously transports could only join a group one at a time, two groups could never merge while carrying cargo or being escorted)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI transports looking for attack city stacks to pick up now require cities to only have at least one dedicated defender, improves AIs ability to pickup troops from prior invasions and island hop
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Assault transports in port now wait for nearby escorts to arrive before launching invasions
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now transfer some troops to the new world to conquer barbarian cities if it isn't doing anything else with them
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Reinforcement sized invasions will also now hunt barb cities if civ has no war plans
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Settler, spy and missionary transports that are not full and but have units coming to load now explicitly wait for them instead of going to do pickups somewhere else
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Changes to CvUnitAI::AI_retreatToCity to stop oscillation of naval units into and out of threatened cities
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Assault transports with cargo no longer move to cities to pickup units which are still being produced (reduces exposure to poaching), won't consider units which were just built in between turns either
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Transports which launch an amphibious invasion will now also drop-off any units which remain on board after the invasion (due to winning combat, seige units) in the captured city instead of transporting them back
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Transports no longer attempt to pickup attack city units recovering in recently captured cities
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Second waves of invasions will now more likely target areas where AI already has captured some cities
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI transports now scrap or switch UNITAI type if owner can build better transports but unit can't upgrade to them (half of fix for Galley->Carrack->Galleon issues)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI ocean-capable transport groups now split off galleys
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI galley assault transports which can upgrade now wait in cities to be upgraded
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Air AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Modified and expanded Solver's changes to retreat from city/fort AI to be more specialized for various unit AI types, only move if there's a real threat
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Increased city danger threshold so enemy aircraft do not retreat so easily
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Attack planes in endangered cities will now more likely to airstrike attackers
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Improved code for defense planes in endangered cities so they stay to defend longer and either airstrike or patrol
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Improved efficiency of danger threshold check for ships and planes
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Improved code for moving planes to offensive or defensive bases to take city threat into account
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI bombers will no longer consider basing in undefended forts even if the fort is unthreatened
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI bombers will now consider moving to a city with two defenders (down from requiring 3), change made because of added threat logic and should allow AI to now use almost all of its cities as airbases
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Fixed bug introduced in Unofficial Patch 0.19 causing bombers to skip their turns whenever an interceptor was around
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Many improvements to better handle damaged planes in threatened cities
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Added two functions for defensive airstrikes to make both air defense and offense units more directly aid in defending cities from enemy stacks
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI air defense units wake from airpatrol every turn, re-decide roles/need
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI air defense units now consider how many other air defense units there are in the city and guarantee air defense
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Air defense units with Interceptor promotions now will be more likely to patrol when city is threatened
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Added new function for weighting bases for attack air units with new consideration for supporting offensive stacks and defending endangered cities, plus keeping planes safe from sneak attacks when at peace
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]When at war forts are now more likely to be used as offensive bases, though cities are still preferred
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will again consider basing attack planes in teammate's territory (plot defense considerations effectively disabled this in many circumstances in earlier versions of mod)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now consider basing attack planes in vassal territory, though it will only use them if it owns no good base cities or forts itself
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Attack air units will now pull out of cities/forts if the defenders leave
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Airstrikes will no longer target enemies in adjacent territory when the territory is only adjacent to owned water tiles
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Fighters now always move before bombers, they're much better at taking on enemy fighters
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]New function in CvPlot to count how many air units are running intercept missions already
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Added emphasis for both offensive and defensive units on the the players primary area
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]If nearby enemies have no attack aircraft, fewer units are needed for air defense (freeing up fighters to make air strikes).  Only applies to players the AI is actually at war with, so their sneak attack preparations remain the same.
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Unit AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will skip bombarding and go straight to attacking cities when it has good initial attack odds and a big strength advantage
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Stranded units with nothing to do will wait once someone is coming to get them instead of mindlessly patrolling
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Stranded settlers will now wait if someone is coming to get them instead of just scrapping after 20 turns
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Attack unit stacks will now break up when assigned to defend workers so that some of the units can do other things (protect other workers, get in transports)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Units set to UNITAI_ATTACK will now get in transports instead of aimlessly patrolling when player is preparing invasion force
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]If attack_city units cannot reach an enemy city while in land war, they will try airlifts and then load into boats
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Tweaked circumstances where attack units load into transports to encourage filling up boats
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Fixed discrepancy where attack units could group with settlers and then get in boats but were highly unlikely to get in boats with waiting settlers
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Speed up to AI_group so it loops over selection groups instead of units
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Attack units now do a bit better of defending cities in the new world if the AI hasn't sent/built enough city defense units yet

		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Removed redundant logic from counter ai routine
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]If an attack city stack is not big enough to go out on its own, but has enough units coming to join it, it will wait instead of traveling a long way to join another forming stack
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Added new flags to AI_group to allow grouping only with transports which are full, in port
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Great people, missionaries, executives now avoid or won't move through enemy territory when running their missions
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Catch several cases where unit deaths can cause strange groupings
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Large groups no longer run choke mission, will go for attacks instead

		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will no longer send missionaries, execs, most great people through enemy territory
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI great generals now strongly avoid traveling in enemy territory when joining units
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Transports will now avoid grouping with those that have different impassability counts (galley vs galleon)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Lowered AI preference for fast UNITAI_ATTACK units (knights, cavalry) when they're not the strongest attackers
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Barbarian AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Barbarian ships will now often blockade cities for a few turns before moving on if they have no nearby targets
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Barb ships trapped by ice or around 1-tile islands are now removed so more can spawn
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Barb ship spawn rate throttled so they don't swamp the seas before players build navies
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Improved barb ship blockade decisions so they stick around for a while but will then should actually move to another area
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Barb ships less suicidal, more oppurtunistic
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Reduced range in which barb ships detect unprotected resources by 25%
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Barbarians now will build defenders in captured cities first, not buildings
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Barb cities now wait to build workers until pop 2
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Barb player no longer feels like it's in financial trouble, meaning it won't spam cottages around it cities or build banks on Terra maps
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Lowered barb players weight on science and gold commerce, so that it rarely builds these types of buildings
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Pirate AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Privateers now prefer moving outside of other teams territory and enter at the last moment for a quick strike
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Fixed issue with AI Privateers being unable to group, also won't run around the whole world just to group
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Cultural Victory AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]If AI moves its capital, it will no longer always block pursuit of cultural victory
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Further boosted AI's valuation of culture yield for second, third place culture city when going for cultural victory 
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]The AI's final city for cultural victory will now build culture much more frequently, tightening up their vcitory
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]General AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Modified city closeness calculations to use population from both cities, not just pop of the other city
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Created functions for determining when cities share the same water area (lake, ocean)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Removed the unused partial implementation of a new A* solver for closeness
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]A bonus which enables the civ's unique unit is now valued more
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Added function to calculate plot strength of teammates and (if desired) vassals
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now be more likely to sacrifice green units when assaulting a well-defended city
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now be reluctant to sacrifice units with medic promotions when assaulting a well-defended city
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Created function PUF_isUnitAITypeGroupee, PUF_isAvailableUnitAITypeGroupee for counting number of unit ai's on a plot in a group of a particular AI type which might actually load onto a transport (aren't already cargo)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Created two path finding flags to weight paths towards avoiding enemy territory, useful for minimizing exposure of attack stacks, loaded transports, or privateers to enemy attack
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Created function to approximate how long it will take for a stack to bombard city defenses to 0
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Added new version of CvPlayerAI::AI_unitTargetMissionAIs which counts how many unit target mission AIs are within a certain range (for detecting units wanting to load on transports)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Added function PUF_isFiniteRangeAndNotJustProduced to allow counting of units who have had at least one turn of their own to move
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Units using path flags MOVE_AVOID_ENEMY_WEIGHT_x now will also try to end each turn not in/adjacent to enemy territory when possible, used by AI transports to there's less likely to be a turn of exposure before invasion
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Added CvSelectionGroup::canMoveAllTerrain to fix issue with all terrain transports in mods
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Added CvSelectionGroupAI::AI_seperateLimitedTransports to fix issue with AI using stacks of mixed galley and galleon transports
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now avoid building invisible escorts since they cannot defend
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Combat Mechanics[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Modification for air v air combat to make veteran units more valuable, especially when wounded.  Air v air combat is now more much more similar to land combat.  This change can be disabled/enabled using BBAI_AIR_COMBAT in GlobalDefinesAlt.xml</Italian>
		<Spanish>[H1]Better BTS AI[\H1][NEWLINE]v0.78
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]New User Interface Features[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]Holding down SHIFT+ALT and clicking on a leader in the scoreboard toggles your civ's warplan between WARPLAN_PREPARING_TOTAL and NO_WARPLAN.  This feature can be used to signal to your vassals that they should begin preparing for war with a particular player as well, allowing them to be much better prepared when you declare.  Any warning you can give your vassals will help, but enough time to build one to two units in a city is best.  WARNING: Use of this feature is not multiplayer compatible, WARPLANs are not sent across the network since they're otherwise only used by the AI and so it will lead to OOS errors if you have vassals.[PARAGRAPH:2]The scoreboard will show WAR in yellow instead of red when you have declared you are planning a war using the above feature.[PARAGRAPH:2]Added line to contact help text explaining that SHIFT+ALT clicking toggles war preparation plans.[PARAGRAPH:2]Air units can now be set to explore, they use the same explore logic as AI planes and then have additional logic if that doesn't push a mission.  Note that planes on auto explore always move at the very beginning of your turn!
		[PARAGRAPH:2]Better BTS AI is a mod component which improves AI behaviour:
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]War Strategy AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Modified how closeness is used for determining who to attack, different setting for regular and aggressive AI
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will consider declaring war for resources, weighted towards resources AI doesn't have and plots that are more easily capture
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Modified city attack targeting by terrain bonuses to consider how important bonus is to AI
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]An AI winning a war no longer automatically accepts offers of capitulation, may continue conquest under a few circumstances
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AIs will no longer declare war on faraway vassals of their neighbors
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]If team is losing a land war badly, they will now use defensive area AI in all areas where there is significant enemy presence
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Modified a losing civs decision to offer capitulation, prior method made capitulation less likely if there were many small capitulated vassals on the map
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Adjusted threshold for offering capitulation based on above change
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI now begins accelerating war plan if it has 1.5x as much power as enemy, instead of only accelerating at higher than 2.0x
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]War tactics AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Attack city stacks will now reduce the distance they travel in enemy territory so the enemy has less time to prepare or hit them with suicide siege
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Attack stacks with decent initial odds and big troop advantage will skip bombarding and just attack (so enemy can't restock)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Attack stacks without much bombard power will now prefer to go after cities with low defense modifiers, effect reduced after AI can build bombers
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Attack stacks without much bombard power are a little bolder in attacking city before defenses are lowered to 0, though they will bombard a few turns to make sure bombers and ships can get some shots in
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Loaded transports coming in for an invasion will now usually move outside opponents territory and adjacent tiles to up surprise factor and reduce exposure to attacks before landing
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now beef up border security a little before a war (as if it has terrible relations with neighbor), not enough to give intentions away
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI now treats a border with a vassal as pretty safe, regardless of relations
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now prefer to stage attack stacks in coastal cities with transports when running invasion for faster loading into boats
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Created new logic for AI to run assault transports to reinforce its existing positions without building up new full invasion force
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI can now time smaller transport loads to arrive at the same time as bigger invasion stacks
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Attack city stacks in own cities now wait if enough units are just about to join before heading off to attack
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI puts less weight on minor civ cities when also at war with major civs
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Vassal AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Vassals will now be better prepared to participate when their AI master is planning a war.  If their master is a human, they will be probabilistically be a bit better prepared.
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Capitulated vassals will now build health improvements more often in cities which need them to help break the population barrier to freedom
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Capitulated vassals will now build culture improvements in more cities with low culture ratings to try to snag more territory and gain their freedom
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]City AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now more likely fill empty transports when enagaged in transcontinental war, making reinforcements and second waves on invasions more likely
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]When doing invasions, AI will now be more likely to have cities with free air experience fill vacancies on carriers
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]When doing invasions, AI will now have cities with high production or free sea experience more often fill needs for aircraft carriers
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]When doing invasions, if AI has at least 50% of its possible missile capacity it will no longer always build missiles
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Rewrote CvCityAI::AI_isAirDefended so that it considers unit damage, movement, AI type and can also count land units
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Normal workboat build blocked if there's an enemy sea unit camping outside city
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Coastal cities will now build boats as if planning a sea invasion if there is no route to enemy cities
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Improved handling of building troops to fill transports, unified between coastal and non-coastal cities
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Non-coastal cities now help fill carriers, missile carriers
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]The AI was blocked from building attack troops if it felt it was unable to build good ones, now if it is at war it can build them but with low probability so it can fight back a little early in the game
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now emergency build fighter planes if its air defenses are shot down but it still has lots of bombers and missiles
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]If not critical, AI will let cities with high production or free air experience usually build most planes
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Cities with military production bonuses now a bit more likely to build military units
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now always build some assault transports if it has significant overseas colonies to help defend them
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now build reserve sea units to defend its settler transports in later eras
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Reduced construction of escorts that are weaker than the transports they would be escorting (Caravels escorting Galleons primarily)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI coastal cities will now act as if running AREAAI_ASSAULT (ie, doing invasion) if team has war plan against a team it can't reach, not just at war
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Blocked coastal cities from gearing up for naval invasions if enemy team isn't on same water area (for cities on inland lakes in maps with oceans)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI cities on inland lakes which are connected through a bridge city to the ocean are now considered to be on "relevant" water areas, meaning they will now help build navies
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Tweaked logic for production of escorts so the AI builds them faster if it doesn't have any
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Adjusted threshold for construction of missionaries when at war, an AI that is on a roll capturing cities will now be more likely to build missionaries to convert the new cities
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Added extra logic for panic production of defensive and counter attack units when AI is losing the wars it is in
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will no longer build Galley settler or troop transports when it has access to Carracks or some other transport which can enter ocean tiles (half of fix for Galley->Carrack->Galleon issues)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Fix for issue with selection of plots to work which led to tiny per turn production in some large coastal cities due to higher weighting on food.  Particularly an issue with coastal cities whose only hammer access is forested plains.  AI coastal cities will now produce at least a few hammers when they have enough food.
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Production of planes for carriers now happens when AI has empty carriers, independent of whether AI is launch invasion.  Should better fill carriers built outside of invasion logic which were often useless before
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Worker AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Fix issue where AI would not build workboats to make use of resources in small lakes (was blocked because it felt lake was not relevant militarily)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Fixed issue where AI workers would load into a galley with a settler, causing a defenseless settler to freze on empty island
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Fixed issue where AI workers responded strongly to temporary commerce/research emphasis decisions (one cause of cottage cycling down)
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Settler AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Fixed bug where settlers with no path to city sites on same continent would idle indefinitely and never load on transports
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Transports will now only unload settlers who actually have a path to city sites in area
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI now has extra encouragement to put cities on water when water access is not ice locked, when ocean is militarily relevant, and if player doesn't have enough coastal cities yet
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI now has extra encouragement to put cities on rivers early in the game
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Transport full with a settler and workers but no defense now dumps the load, no longer delivers the sitting ducks to remote island/new world alone
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Settler transports which have a settler on board no longer look for other settler to pick up, now explicitly look for extra city defense units (only one settler will load anyway, chasing additional settlers was just a waste of time before)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will not send out new colonists when it is already in financial trouble
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Espionage AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]When a spy has waited in a city but has no mission available, they are now more likely to move around and explore instead of sitting
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Revamped desired Espionage rate and priority weighting calculations, AI now always update weights, relations play a larger role
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Neutral priority weighting is now 10 instead of 0, differentiates between 
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]When AI starts preparing for war against another player they will heavily shift their espionage spending towards that player
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will attempt to gain passive mission levels against adversaries
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now actually load spies onto the spy transport it builds
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Smoothed and rebalanced AI's weighting on espionage yield, previously was either equal to production (!) or 0.  This issue caused the overemphasis on spy specialists by governors.
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]City govenor weighting of espionage yield now responsive to player's positioning of espionage slider
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Gold AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI now has a budget for troop upgrades each turn based on how much gold it wants to have, it won't spend more than this budget on non-critical units when at peace
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI now prioritizes upgrading escort ships to same extent as transports
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Tweaks so that AI emphasizes/deemphasizes gold yield in a broader range of circumstances, will help AI and city governors make better choices when doing all out science or culture and also if having money problems.
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Civic AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI now will more readily change civics in a golden age, acts as if it is spiritual
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Diplomacy AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Removed blanket acceptance of all proposals by secretaries the AI is friends with, now just auto accept less strategic proposals like extra trade routes
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Being friends with secretary now influences civics and other strategic proposals
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI now more likely to defy civic proposals which are bad for it, particularly on Aggressive AI
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Reworked AI voting on forced peace, added thresholds so winning/losing calculations are more meaningful (no longer losing a war in which no units have fought, unless being dogpiled)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]For forced peace proposals, added considerations for whether peace team is winning or losing big
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AIs which are third parties to the war in question may now vote to continue it for selfish reasons (share wars with peace team, are planning to attack peace team)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now only defy forced peace if it is doing quite well in the war, increased use of personality so warmongers are much more likely to defy
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Vassals will now vote for forced war proposal under some circustances.  Previously they were blocked from voting for a war they weren't already in since they can't declare war on their own.  (Vassals of player to be attacked always vote no still)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now always vote for a forced war proposal against a player they are planning to attack anyway in addition to always voting yes if already at war
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]For forced war vote, replaced blanket check on whether AI doesn't hate victim with roll based on AI's attitude-based peace probability
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Averaging of attitudes of vassals and masters is now done using the more accurate +- attitude value, not the attitude type
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Naval AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Modified bombard behavior. Priority remains on supporting player's ground troops, if none then consider supporting other troops with common enemy and spreading out stacks to increase reach of blockade.
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Modified and expanded Solver's changes to retreat from city/fort AI to be more specialized for various unit AI types, only move if there's a real threat
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Increased city danger threshold so enemy ships do not runaway so easily
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Damaged ships will stay unless city is highly threatened
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Galleons assigned escort roles before Frigates are available will now change their UnitAI type to assault transport instead of getting stuck in their role after better escorts come along
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Transport ships waiting in port will now only unload their cargo during a land war if an enemy city can be reached by land, the player is on the defensive locally, or a stack of enemy units shows up.  Increases naval invasions of distant enemies on Pangea maps, sea assaults to complement land assaults.
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Assault flotillas now leave behind empty transports
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Assault ships now assume cities whose defenses the player can't see are properly defended (previously counted as a single defender). Should make invasions more likely to occur near blockades, attack ships, prior invasions.
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now try to break blockades if it has many attack ships in port
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Transports will now pickup units stranded on small islands
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Transports looking for cargo to pickup now use PUF_isAvailableGroupHeadUnitAIType instead of just counting unit ai types, should stop assault transports from waiting forever for units attached to a settler to load or waiting forever on small islands for units already in their cargo to load
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]EscortAI units will now also shadow settler_sea units when there is nothing else to do
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Added a pathlength consideration to AI_pickup so that mostly loaded flotillas don't sail around the world to pickup one more unit (previously they would have waited trying to load the units they already had on board until someone else came around)

		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Slow escorts (Caravels mainly) will now protect large flotillas instead of doing nothing

		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Assault transports at sea will now wait for escorts, other transports etc that are about to join them
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Assault transports that aren't full but have enough units for an invasion will now wait one more turn if there are units about to load onboard or group with them
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Improved grouping of AI transports, two groups with multiple transports each can now group together to form one big enough to invade (previously transports could only join a group one at a time, two groups could never merge while carrying cargo or being escorted)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI transports looking for attack city stacks to pick up now require cities to only have at least one dedicated defender, improves AIs ability to pickup troops from prior invasions and island hop
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Assault transports in port now wait for nearby escorts to arrive before launching invasions
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will now transfer some troops to the new world to conquer barbarian cities if it isn't doing anything else with them
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Reinforcement sized invasions will also now hunt barb cities if civ has no war plans
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Settler, spy and missionary transports that are not full and but have units coming to load now explicitly wait for them instead of going to do pickups somewhere else
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Changes to CvUnitAI::AI_retreatToCity to stop oscillation of naval units into and out of threatened cities
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Assault transports with cargo no longer move to cities to pickup units which are still being produced (reduces exposure to poaching), won't consider units which were just built in between turns either
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Transports which launch an amphibious invasion will now also drop-off any units which remain on board after the invasion (due to winning combat, seige units) in the captured city instead of transporting them back
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Transports no longer attempt to pickup attack city units recovering in recently captured cities
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Second waves of invasions will now more likely target areas where AI already has captured some cities
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI transports now scrap or switch UNITAI type if owner can build better transports but unit can't upgrade to them (half of fix for Galley->Carrack->Galleon issues)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI ocean-capable transport groups now split off galleys
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI galley assault transports which can upgrade now wait in cities to be upgraded
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Air AI[\BOLD]

		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]New function in CvPlot to count how many air units are running intercept missions already
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Added emphasis for both offensive and defensive units on the the players primary area
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]If nearby enemies have no attack aircraft, fewer units are needed for air defense (freeing up fighters to make air strikes).  Only applies to players the AI is actually at war with, so their sneak attack preparations remain the same.
		[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Unit AI[\BOLD]
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]AI will skip bombarding and go straight to attacking cities when it has good initial attack odds and a big strength advantage
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Stranded units with nothing to do will wait once someone is coming to get them instead of mindlessly patrolling
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Stranded settlers will now wait if someone is coming to get them instead of just scrapping after 20 turns
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Attack unit stacks will now break up when assigned to defend workers so that some of the units can do other things (protect other workers, get in transports)
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Units set to UNITAI_ATTACK will now get in transports instead of aimlessly patrolling when player is preparing invasion force

		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Speed up to AI_group so it loops over selection groups instead of units
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Attack units now do a bit better of defending cities in the new world if the AI hasn't sent/built enough city defense units yet

		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Removed redundant logic from counter ai routine
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]If an attack city stack is not big enough to go out on its own, but has enough units coming to join it, it will wait instead of traveling a long way to join another forming stack
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Added new flags to AI_group to allow grouping only with transports which are full, in port
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Great people, missionaries, executives now avoid or won't move through enemy territory when running their missions

		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Barbarian ships will now often blockade cities for a few turns before moving on if they have no nearby targets
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Barb ships trapped by ice or around 1-tile islands are now removed so more can spawn
		[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Barb ship spawn rate throttled so they don't swamp the seas before players build navies

First of all there's plenty of new improvement types and secondly all the improvements gain extra bonuses from later era techs and/or civics. One other major change how improvements work is that many improvements no longer require you to clear out forests or jungle from the plot before you can build the improvement. This means that for example [LINK=IMPROVEMENT_MINE]Mines[\LINK] can be built on all forest plots before you research [LINK=TECH_BRONZE_WORKING]Bronze Working[\LINK] and in fact Mine does get extra hammer when the plot has forest! Improvements like [LINK=IMPROVEMENT_FARM]farms[\LINK], [LINK=IMPROVEMENT_COTTAGE]cottages[\LINK] and [LINK=IMPROVEMENT_PLANTATION]plantation[\LINK] still require you to cut down the forests or jungles.</English>

Because of these terrain changes, the regular mapscripts from Civ 4, Warlords and from Beyond the Sword won't work correctly. For this reason all the default and other custom mapscripts have been disabled and all those mapscripts have been converted to work with Rise of Mankind mod. All the changed mapscripts start with the text "RoM_", if the mapscript you are trying to use does not have this prefix, you might encounter problems when game is generating the map. Some converted mapscripts are still unable to generate Marsh terrain (these require still some python "fixes" before they can place Marsh terrain) but new terrain feature Peat Bog should appear on all maps since it is set to appear also on tundra.[PARAGRAPH:2]Rise of Mankind adds 2 new map sizes: Giant and Gigantic. These maps are extra large and should be tried only on high end computers. There are still some issues with these new map sizes, meaning that some mapscripts won't work correctly for these new map sizes and the script won't place terrain correctly - more advanced mapscripts, like Smartmap, can handle these new map sizes without problems - if you encounter problems on Giant and Gigantic mapsizes on certain mapscripts, I recommend using max Huge map size.[PARAGRAPH:2]Basic mapscripts are shown in list when you click Single Player and then Play Now.

		<English>[H1]Civics[\H1][PARAGRAPH:2]Rise of Mankind mod overhauls the civic system from Beyond the Sword completely. Starting from version 2.5 the system is based on discussions in Rise of Mankind forum section in www.civfanatics.com (earlier Rise of Mankind used combination of other civic mods). The civic system consists now 7 categories: Government, Power, Society, Economy, Religion, Welfare and Future. At the start players can use the categories from Government up to Welfare and once you reach the future technologies, new future civic options will become available. Each category has 8 civic options, except Future category which has five. The new system is based on organic ideas that can overlap and some of the new options are bit abstract - this increases learning curve but once you have played few games with the new system, you will master it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Categories:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][COLOR_HIGHLIGHT_TEXT]GOVERNMENT[COLOR_REVERT][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]The ideological basis for the civilization, the executive power.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_UNIT_TEXT]Chiefdom[COLOR_REVERT] - State ruled by a chief or a number of chiefs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_UNIT_TEXT]Despotism[COLOR_REVERT] - State ruled by a dictator.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_UNIT_TEXT]Monarchy[COLOR_REVERT] - State ruled by a hereditary king or emperor.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_UNIT_TEXT]Democracy[COLOR_REVERT] - Representative democracy.

		<French>[H1]Civics[\H1][PARAGRAPH:2]Rise of Mankind mod overhauls the civic system from Beyond the Sword completely. Starting from version 2.5 the system is based on discussions in Rise of Mankind forum section in www.civfanatics.com (earlier Rise of Mankind used combination of other civic mods). The civic system consists now 7 categories: Government, Power, Society, Economy, Religion, Welfare and Future. At the start players can use the categories from Government up to Welfare and once you reach the future technologies, new future civic options will become available.

		<Spanish>[H1]Civics[\H1][PARAGRAPH:2]Rise of Mankind mod overhauls the civic system from Beyond the Sword completely. Starting from version 2.5 the system is based on discussions in Rise of Mankind forum section in www.civfanatics.com (earlier Rise of Mankind used combination of other civic mods). The civic system consists now 7 categories: Government, Power, Society, Economy, Religion, Welfare and Future. At the start players can use the categories from Government up to Welfare and once you reach the future technologies, new future civic options will become available. Each category has 8 civic options, except Future category which has five. The new system is based on organic ideas that can overlap and some of the new options are bit abstract - this increases learning curve but once you have played few games with the new system, you will master it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Categories:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][COLOR_HIGHLIGHT_TEXT]GOVERNMENT[COLOR_REVERT][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]The ideological basis for the civilization, the executive power.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_UNIT_TEXT]Chiefdom[COLOR_REVERT] - State ruled by a chief or a number of chiefs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_UNIT_TEXT]Despotism[COLOR_REVERT] - State ruled by a dictator.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_UNIT_TEXT]Monarchy[COLOR_REVERT] - State ruled by a hereditary king or emperor.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_UNIT_TEXT]Democracy[COLOR_REVERT] - Representative democracy.

		<English>[H1]Advanced Combat Odds[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]by PieceOfMind[PARAGRAPH:2]Right from the outset, make sure you understand that all odds in the Advanced Combat Odds display are rounded to 1 or 2 decimal places. Displayed odds of 100.00%, for example, could represent 99.995% or greater meaning the odds are not certain. Similarly, 0.00% does not mean zero odds - just very small odds.[PARAGRAPH:2]There are now four settings for the level of detail you wish to have displayed using this mod: Low, Medium, High and Everything! Medium is the default setting and recommended for most users.[PARAGRAPH:2]Advanced Combat Odds aims to be more accurate, relevant and informative than the original odds calculator. See the included text file for a list of features available at each detail setting.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]What do all the values mean?[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Survival Odds:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]These are simple - the odds of both the attacker (green) and defender (red) surviving.  Sometimes using units like catapults means the defender will have 100% odds; This is because the attacker cannot kill the defender and must withdraw before dealing a killing blow.[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Victory:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]The odds of the attacker killing the defender.  Also presented on this line is the number of XP the attacker would earn if he wins.  At Medium detail and higher, there is an additional value on this line.  This value is the average hitpoints of the attacker if he kills the defender.[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Withdraw:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]These are the odds of a forced withdrawal from combat.  Units like catapults and cannons, which have a combat limit, cannot kill a defending unit.  Instead they can only damage the defender down to a certain level (eg. 25HP for catapults, 20HP for cannons, 15HP for artillery).  The XP a unit earns for withdrawal is 1XP.  At the end of this line, the average values of both attacker and defender HP are presented for the withdrawal battle outcome (for Medium detail and higher).  Note average defender HP on this line corresponds to the damage limit of the unit you are using to attack.[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Retreat:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]If you are using units that have inherent retreat odds or that have earned promotions that give them retreat chances, then this line tells you the probability of your unit retreating.  Units will only retreat if they are one hit away from being killed, and only when they are the attacker.  The HP value presented on this line (Medium detail and higher) is the number of hitpoints the attacker would have if he were to retreat from the battle injured.[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Defeat:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]The odds of the attacker being killed by the defender.  The XP the defender will earn is displayed, along with the average number of hitpoints the defender will have if he survives combat (Medium detail and higher).[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Detailed Attacker HP Outcomes:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]At the High and Everything, these values will be displayed directly under the battle outcomes representing the attacker surviving.  For each number of hitpoints the attacker could possibly have, beside it you will find the probability of the unit exiting battle with that many hitpoints.  There is also a coloured bar beside each outcome, to help visually identify the scope of the values.  Note if there are retreat odds involved, the lowest HP value for the attacker will include the probability of retreat in its odds.  Note the sum of all the HP outcomes should be the same as the odds of the attacker surviving.[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Detailed Defender HP Outcomes:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]Much the same as Attacker HP Outcomes, except for the defender.  Note the sum of all these values should be the odds of the defender surviving.[PARAGRAPH:2]Attacker/Defender damager per hit, number of hits required, odds of hits and CombatRatio: A lot of data is displayed on this line.  The first two values are the amount of HP damage each of the attacker and defender (respectively) will cause per hit.  Then after that, the number of 

hits required by each combatant are displayed.  In green, is the number of hits required by the attacker to kill the defender or to force the attacker's withdrawal due to a combat limit.  In red is the number of hits required for the defender to make to either kill the attacker or to make him retreat.  Next, the odds displayed in green are the odds of the attacker for making a hit in each combat round.  The defender's odds are just 100% minus this number.  Finally on this line is the important value called the CombatRatio or simply R.  This value is equal to the attacker's modified combat strength divided by the defender's modified combat strength.  This number is important for many reasons - one being that it determines how many XP the attacker and defender can earn from combat.  The value R takes both injured units and all combat related modifiers into account (e.g. promotions and defense bonuses).[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Average HP: (High detail an above)[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]This line simply gives the average hitpoints for each combatant after battle.  Unlike the averages presented earlier, these averages include the possibility of the unit dying, so they better reflect the overall outcome of battle.[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Unharmed:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]These odds are very simple.  They are the odds of the attacker/defender exiting combat without taking a single hit i.e. unharmed.  Units that are already injured are counted as winning unharmed if they don't take damage during the battle.[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Unrouneded XP:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]These values are shown at Everything detail only.  These values are rounded down to the nearest whole number, and then forced to be within 1 and 10, to give the actual XP that can be earned by each combatant for killing their opponent. [PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]XP range:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]This line is only shown at Everything detail, and it crams a lot of information on one line.  In the middle, it presents the CombatRatio i.e. the R value, and the XP it corresponds to.  On either side of it, the CombatRatios that would lead to different number of XP earned are shown.  If you increase the value of R (for example, by taking a Combat promotion) then tipping it over the next value will cause your XP earned to drop by 1 point.</English>

Sometimes using units like catapults means the defender will have 100% odds; This is because the attacker cannot kill the defender and must withdraw before dealing a killing blow.[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Victory:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]The odds of the attacker killing the defender.  Also presented on this line is the number of XP the attacker would earn if he wins.  At Medium detail and higher, there is an additional value on this line.  This value is the average hitpoints of the attacker if he kills the defender.[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Withdraw:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]These are the odds of a forced withdrawal from combat.  Units like catapults and cannons, which have a combat limit, cannot kill a defending unit.  Instead they can only damage the defender down to a certain level (eg. 25HP for catapults, 20HP for cannons, 15HP for artillery).  The XP a unit earns for withdrawal is 1XP.  At the end of this line, the average values of both attacker and defender HP are presented for the withdrawal battle outcome (for Medium detail and higher).  Note average defender HP on this line corresponds to the damage limit of the unit you are using to attack.[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Retreat:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]If you are using units that have inherent retreat odds or that have earned promotions that give them retreat chances, then this line tells you the probability of your unit retreating.  Units will only retreat if they are one hit away from being killed, and only when they are the attacker.  The HP value presented on this line (Medium detail and higher) is the number of hitpoints the attacker would have if he were to retreat from the battle injured.[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Defeat:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]The odds of the attacker being killed by the defender.  The XP the defender will earn is displayed, along with the average number of hitpoints the defender will have if he survives combat (Medium detail and higher).[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Detailed Attacker HP Outcomes:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]At the High and Everything, these values will be displayed directly under the battle outcomes representing the attacker surviving.  For each number of hitpoints the attacker could possibly have, beside it you will find the probability of the unit exiting battle with that many hitpoints.  There is also a coloured bar beside each outcome, to help visually identify the scope of the values.  Note if there are retreat odds involved, the lowest HP value for the attacker will include the probability of retreat in its odds.  Note the sum of all the HP outcomes should be the same as the odds of the attacker surviving.[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Detailed Defender HP Outcomes:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]Much the same as Attacker HP Outcomes, except for the defender.  Note the sum of all these values should be the odds of the defender surviving.[PARAGRAPH:2]Attacker/Defender damager per hit, number of hits required, odds of hits and CombatRatio: A lot of data is displayed on this line.  The first two values are the amount of HP damage each of the attacker and defender (respectively) will cause per hit.  Then after that, the number of h

its required by each combatant are displayed.  In green, is the number of hits required by the attacker to kill the defender or to force the attacker's withdrawal due to a combat limit.  In red is the number of hits required for the defender to make to either kill the attacker or to make him retreat.  Next, the odds displayed in green are the odds of the attacker for making a hit in each combat round.  The defender's odds are just 100% minus this number.  Finally on this line is the important value called the CombatRatio or simply R.  This value is equal to the attacker's modified combat strength divided by the defender's modified combat strength.  This number is important for many reasons - one being that it determines how many XP the attacker and defender can earn from combat.  The value R takes both injured units and all combat related modifiers into account (e.g. promotions and defense bonuses).[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Average HP: (High detail an above)[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]This line simply gives the average hitpoints for each combatant after battle.  Unlike the averages presented earlier, these averages include the possibility of the unit dying, so they better reflect the overall outcome of battle.[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Unharmed:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]These odds are very simple.  They are the odds of the attacker/defender exiting combat without taking a single hit i.e. unharmed.  Units that are already injured are counted as winning unharmed if they don't take damage during the battle.[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Unrouneded XP:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]These values are shown at Everything detail only.  These values are rounded down to the nearest whole number, and then forced to be within 1 and 10, to give the actual XP that can be earned by each combatant for killing their opponent. [PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]XP range:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]This line is only shown at Everything detail, and it crams a lot of information on one line.  In the middle, it presents the CombatRatio i.e. the R value, and the XP it corresponds to.  On either side of it, the CombatRatios that would lead to different number of XP earned are shown.  If you increase the value of R (for example, by taking a Combat promotion) then tipping it over the next value will cause your XP earned to drop by 1 point.</French>
