While this does allow sailing, there are several problems with these designs. First, the boat can only sail downwind, meaning movement is only possible in the direction the wind is blowing; secondly, this only allows the boat to travel at the speed of the wind. Sail design evolved slowly over the centuries, and eventually the concepts of tacking and trimming started to be understood, allowing sailing to be against the wind and faster than the wind speed. These advancements enabled the exploration and settlement of far off lands, as ships were able to return from uncharted waters.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Slavery is an institution based on a relationship of dominance and submission, whereby one person owns another and can exact from that person labor or other services. Slavery has been found among many groups of low material culture, as in the Malay Peninsula and among some Native Americans; it also has occurred in more highly developed societies, such as the southern United States.[PARAGRAPH:2]Although it is commonly held that slavery was rare among primitive pastoral peoples and that it appeared in full form only with the development of an agricultural economy, there are numerous instances that contradict this belief. Domestic slavery and sometimes concubine slavery appeared among the nomadic Arabs, among Native Americans primarily devoted to hunting, and among the seafaring Vikings. Some ascribe the beginnings of slavery to war and the consequent subjection of one group by another. Slavery as a result of debt, however, existed in very early times, and some African peoples have had the custom of putting up wives and children as hostages for an obligation; if the obligation was unfulfilled, the hostages became permanent slaves.[PARAGRAPH:2]The institution of slavery extends back beyond recorded history. References to it appear in the ancient Babylonian code of Hammurabi. Its form and nature varied greatly in ancient society. It seems to have been common in the Tigris-Euphrates civilizations and in ancient Persia. In ancient Egypt slave labor was used in building temples and pyramids. The institution was familiar to the ancient Hebrews, according to passages in the Bible. [PARAGRAPH:2]Slavery was an established institution in the Greece of Homer's time, and a large portion of the population of the Greek city-states in later days were of the servile class. There were domestic slaves, agricultural slaves, and artisans and workers. In Greece, although not quite as commonly as in Asia Minor, there were also public slaves, for example, those belonging to the temples. In general it is thought that slaves in the Greek city-states were relatively well treated, and there were laws protecting them against excessive cruelty or abuse. However, the slaves were regarded as property and had no rights in courts of law. Slaves could obtain their freedom by buying it, by being granted it in the owner's will, or as a reward for outstanding service.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Elephants are regarded as among the most intelligent of mammals and can be trained to work and to perform. Indian elephants are extensively used as beasts of burden, especially in teak forests, where they carry logs with their trunks. They are not considered truly domesticated, as they do not breed well in captivity; young animals are captured from the wild. Training and handling take skill, as elephants have complex emotions and vary individually in temperament. African elephants are often said to be less tractable, but they too were formerly used for work, as well as for warfare. Hannibal's army crossed the Alps using 37 African elephants, which were at that time probably found in the Atlas Mts. Elephants seen in zoos and circuses are usually of the Indian species, although the famous Jumbo, who toured the United States in the late 19th century giving rides to children, was an African elephant. In Thailand and Myanmar (Burma), albino elephants have long been held sacred. Elephants have been extensively hunted for food and for ivory, and their numbers are now greatly reduced; however, they are now afforded protection in certain areas which is helping to prevent the destruction of their numbers.</English>

Flemish weavers brought to England by William the Conqueror and later by Queen Elizabeth I gave a great impetus to the craft there, and Lancashire became an important center. Tapestry weaving was brought to a high art in France. In colonial America weaving was a household industry allied with agriculture.[PARAGRAPH:2]The 18th-century weaving and spinning inventions marked the transition from the old era of domestic craftsmanship to the tremendous, organized industry of today. The factory system of machine weaving produces quantities of standardized material for mass consumption; the result is a loss of the distinctive elements of quality and design. Some of the finest silks, velvets, table linens, and carpets are still woven on handlooms.</Spanish>

A surviving scrap of papyrus warns the soldier against military life because of its rigors and the propensity of commanders to use beatings and other physical punishments to induce discipline. The first good description of military training in ancient armies was produced by the Greek historian Strabo, who noted that Cyrus introduced universal military training among the Persians. The conscript underwent 10 years of military training, probably as a reservist, before being enlisted in the regular army. Training was vigorous and included physical conditioning, instruction in the bow and javelin, and horsemanship. Recruits were also trained to forage for food, prepare meals in the field, and make and repair weapons. The recruit was indoctrinated in the military code of the Persian army and taught to "ride well, shoot straight, and tell the truth."</English>

The debate between fundamentalists and modernists was most acute among the Baptists and the Presbyterians but also arose within other denominations. In a highly publicized case, the so-called Monkey Trial (1925), the fundamentalist leader William Jennings Bryan won Tennessee's case against J. T.

However, other attempts by fundamentalists in the 1920s to rid the churches of modernism and the schools of evolution failed.[PARAGRAPH:2]By the 1930s many fundamentalists began to withdraw into independent churches and splinter denominations, and fundamentalism became identified in the public mind with anti-intellectualism and extremism. Many fundamentalists rejected this image, and a movement was begun in the late 1940s to present their position in both a more scholarly and popular way. This movement, known as neoevangelicalism (or, more simply, evangelicalism), sought a wider following from the major denominations through its various schools, youth programs, publications, and radio broadcasts. The separatists saw these efforts as compromising fundamentalist views and sought to disassociate themselves from these religious institutions and such well-known evangelical fundamentalists as Billy Graham.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Heraldry in its most general sense encompasses all matters relating to the duties and responsibilities of officers of arms. To most, though, heraldry is the practice of designing, displaying, describing, and recording coats of arms and badges. Historically, it has been variously described as "the shorthand of history" (Fox-Davies), "the floral border in the garden of history" (Moncreiffe and Pottinger) and "future-proofed branding" (Clackson). The origins of heraldry lie in the need to distinguish participants in combat when their faces were hidden by iron and steel helmets. Eventually a system of rules developed into the modern form of heraldry.[PARAGRAPH:2]The system of blazoning arms that is used today was developed by the officers of arms since the dawn of the art. This includes a description of the escutcheon (shield), the crest, and, if present, supporters, mottoes, and other insignia. An understanding of these rules is one of the keys to sound practice of heraldry. The rules do differ from country to country, but there are some aspects that carry over in each jurisdiction.[PARAGRAPH:2]Though heraldry is nearly 900 years old, it is still very much in use. Many cities and towns in Europe and around the world still make use of arms. Personal heraldry, both legally protected and lawfully assumed, has continued to be used around the world.

		<English>[TAB]Naval tactics in the Age of Sail were primarily determined by the sailing and fighting qualities of the sailing warships of the time. Three factors, in particular, constrained what a sailing admiral could order his fleet to do.[PARAGRAPH:2]The first constraint was that, like all sailing vessels, sailing warships cannot sail directly into the wind. Most could sail not much closer than 70 degrees off the wind. This limited the maneuverability of a fleet during battles at close quarters.[PARAGRAPH:2]The second constraint was that the ships of the time carried their guns in two large batteries, one on each broadside, with only a few mounted to fire directly ahead or astern. The sailing warship was immensely powerful on its sides, but very weak on its bow and stern. The sides of the ship were built with strong timbers, but the stern, in particular, was fragile with a flimsy structure round the large windows of the officers’ cabins. The bows and, particularly, the sterns of the ship were vulnerable to raking fire. Raking another ship by firing the length of a ship from either the bow or stern caused tremendous damage, because a single shot would fly down the length of the decks, while the ship being raked could not return fire with her broadsides.[PARAGRAPH:2]The third constraint was the difficulty of communicating at sea. Written communication was almost impossible in a moving fleet, while hailing was extremely difficult above the noise of wind and weather. So admirals were forced to rely on a pre-arranged set of signal flags hoisted aboard the admiral's flagship. In the smoke of battle, these were often hard or impossible to see. -- Wikipedia</English>

Three factors, in particular, constrained what a sailing admiral could order his fleet to do.[PARAGRAPH:2]The first constraint was that, like all sailing vessels, sailing warships cannot sail directly into the wind. Most could sail not much closer than 70 degrees off the wind. This limited the maneuverability of a fleet during battles at close quarters.[PARAGRAPH:2]The second constraint was that the ships of the time carried their guns in two large batteries, one on each broadside, with only a few mounted to fire directly ahead or astern. The sailing warship was immensely powerful on its sides, but very weak on its bow and stern. The sides of the ship were built with strong timbers, but the stern, in particular, was fragile with a flimsy structure round the large windows of the officers’ cabins. The bows and, particularly, the sterns of the ship were vulnerable to raking fire. Raking another ship by firing the length of a ship from either the bow or stern caused tremendous damage, because a single shot would fly down the length of the decks, while the ship being raked could not return fire with her broadsides.[PARAGRAPH:2]The third constraint was the difficulty of communicating at sea. Written communication was almost impossible in a moving fleet, while hailing was extremely difficult above the noise of wind and weather. So admirals were forced to rely on a pre-arranged set of signal flags hoisted aboard the admiral's flagship. In the smoke of battle, these were often hard or impossible to see. -- Wikipedia</Italian>

		<English>[TAB]Cavalry tactics have evolved over time. Tactically, the main advantages of cavalry over infantry troops were greater mobility, bigger impact and a higher position. [PARAGRAPH:2]One of the cavalry tactics employed was the caracole, developed in the mid-16th century in an attempt to integrate gunpowder weapons into cavalry tactics. Equipped with one or two wheellock pistols, cavalrymen would advance on their target at less than a gallop. As each rank came into range, the soldiers would turn away, discharge their pistols at the target, retire to reload, and then repeat the manoeuvre. In early times they had an advantage in firepower, but infantry firepower increased. With the invention of the bayonet, the pike screen against charges could also be turned into firing soldiers. The tactic was accompanied by the increasing popularity of the German Reiter in Europan armies from about 1540 or similar equipped, but usually lighter armoured Hakkapeliitta. Their main weapons were two or more pistols and a sword; first most wore three-quarters armor, though as time passed this was reduced to a helmet and a cuirass over a buff leather coat; sometimes they also carried a long cavalry firearm known as an arquebus or a carbine (although this type of horsemen soon became regarded as a separate class of cavalry - the arquebusier or in Britain harquebusier). [PARAGRAPH:2]Modern historians regard the caracole as a tactical system that ultimately proved ineffective. It sacrificed the cavalry advantages of speed and mobility, while also leaving mounted soldiers at a disadvantage to massed infantry equipped with heavier and longer-ranged weapons. The caracole gave way to close artillery support deployed to break up the infantry formations and force the foot soldiers to scatter so that the cavalry would regain their advantage in close-quarters combat. [PARAGRAPH:2]With increasing firepower and no sufficient protection, the role of cavalry on the battlefield was slowly reduced. Light cavalry with fireams could return fire, but the aim was not as good as for infantry. So most important for cavalry was the ability to quickly attack enemy cavalry or scattered infantry with lances and sabres (cold steel). Speed reduced the time vulnerable to gunfire, but still closed formations became impossible to take. This tactic was a striking surprise of Mongolian light cavalry in the battle of the Kalka River. The alternative was to use them as dragoons, reaching their positions quickly, dismounting and firefighting like infantry. Such a way of fighting had started in Europe at least in the 13th century with mounted longbow and crossbow archers, but was also employed by the Mongols with their Buryatian longbows.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The ancient Romans used a consolidated scheme for city planning, developed for military defense and civil convenience. The basic plan is a central forum with city services, surrounded by a compact rectilinear grid of streets and wrapped in a wall for defense. To reduce travel times, two diagonal streets cross the square grid corner-to-corner, passing through the central square. A river usually flows through the city, to provide water and transport, and carry away sewage, even in sieges. Effectively, many European towns still preserve the essence of these schemes, as in Turin.The Romans had a very logical way of designing their cities. They put all the streets at right angles, set up in a square grid. All the roads were equal in width and length except for two. These two roads formed the center of the grid and intersected in the middle. One went East/West, the other North/South. They were slightly wider than the others. All roads were made of carefully fitted stones and smaller hard packed stones. Bridges were also constructed where needed. Each square marked by four roads was called an insulae. An insulae was the Roman equivalent of a city block. Each insulae was 80 yards square. The land of each insulae was divided up. As the city developed, each insulae would eventually be filled with buildings of various shapes and sizes and would be crisscrossed with back roads and alleys. Most insulae were given to the first settlers of a budding new Roman city, but each person had to pay for the building of their own houses. The city was surrounded by a wall to protect the city from invaders and other enemies, and to mark the cities limits. Area outside of the walls and city limits was left for farmland. At the end of each main road, there was a large gateway with watchtowers. A portcullis covered the opening when the city was under siege. Other watchtowers were constructed around the rest of the city’s wall. An aqueduct was built outside of the city's walls. This brought in the water necessary for the city's functioning.</English>

All roads were made of carefully fitted stones and smaller hard packed stones. Bridges were also constructed where needed. Each square marked by four roads was called an insulae. An insulae was the Roman equivalent of a city block. Each insulae was 80 yards square. The land of each insulae was divided up. As the city developed, each insulae would eventually be filled with buildings of various shapes and sizes and would be crisscrossed with back roads and alleys. Most insulae were given to the first settlers of a budding new Roman city, but each person had to pay for the building of their own houses. The city was surrounded by a wall to protect the city from invaders and other enemies, and to mark the cities limits. Area outside of the walls and city limits was left for farmland. At the end of each main road, there was a large gateway with watchtowers. A portcullis covered the opening when the city was under siege. Other watchtowers were constructed around the rest of the city’s wall. An aqueduct was built outside of the city's walls. This brought in the water necessary for the city's functioning.</Italian>
		<Spanish>[TAB]The ancient Romans used a consolidated scheme for city planning, developed for military defense and civil convenience. The basic plan is a central forum with city services, surrounded by a compact rectilinear grid of streets and wrapped in a wall for defense. To reduce travel times, two diagonal streets cross the square grid corner-to-corner, passing through the central square. A river usually flows through the city, to provide water and transport, and carry away sewage, even in sieges. Effectively, many European towns still preserve the essence of these schemes, as in Turin.The Romans had a very logical way of designing their cities. They put all the streets at right angles, set up in a square grid. All the roads were equal in width and length except for two.

		<English>[TAB]Photography is the process of recording pictures by means of capturing light on a light-sensitive medium, such as a film or electronic sensor. Light patterns reflected or emitted from objects expose a sensitive silver halide based chemical or electronic medium during a timed exposure, usually through a photographic lens in a device known as a camera that also stores the resulting information chemically or electronically.[PARAGRAPH:2]Photography is the result of combining several technical discoveries. Long before the first photographs were made, Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) (965–1040) invented the camera obscura and pinhole camera, Albertus Magnus (1193–1280) discovered silver nitrate, and Georges Fabricius (1516–1571) discovered silver chloride. Daniel Barbaro described a diaphragm in 1568. Wilhelm Homberg described how light darkened some chemicals (photochemical effect) in 1694.

		<English>[TAB]Early guns required reloading after every bullet that was fired. Although the method that was employed to reload the gun was improved over the years, such as bolt action rifles, each round still required manual insertion into the chamber, requiring over a second to reload. Compared to modern automatic weapons that can fire in some cases several thousand bullets a minute, this is very slow. One of the first automatic weapons that was used was the Gatling gun, which was first used in the American Civil War. This early automatic weapon relied on the forceful recoil of each bullet to prime the next, and so on. This enabled the rate of fire to increase, but the gun itself was very unwieldy and not exceptionally accurate.By World War I, the concept had been vastly improved in the shape of the Vicker’s machinegun, which was able to fire hundreds of bullets a minute. Similar versions were used by all the combatants of the war, and these machine guns enabled stalemate that was seen in the war, as well as the levels of casualties that were seen. These early guns also required water cooling of the barrel to prevent overheating. All these guns required the mechanical action to reload the next bullet in the chamber, which while a practical solution was not ideal. A better, if more sophisticated method was found and that utilized some of the gasses that were produced to load the chamber. This method required far less force to function, and hence allowed an increase in the level of accuracy.

For example, armoured personnel carriers were generally replaced by infantry fighting vehicles in a very similar role, but the latter has some capabilities lacking in the former. [PARAGRAPH:2]The tank is an all terrain, armoured fighting vehicle, designed primarily to engage enemy forces by the use of direct fire in the frontal assault role. Though several configurations have been tried, particularly in the early experimental days of tank development, a standard, mature design configuration has since emerged to a generally accepted pattern. This features a main artillery gun, mounted in a fully rotating turret atop a tracked automotive hull, with various additional machine guns throughout. [PARAGRAPH:2]Armoured personnel carriers (APCs) are light armoured fighting vehicles for the transport of infantry. They usually have only a machine gun although variants carry recoilless rifles, anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs), or mortars. They are not really designed to take part in a direct-fire battle, but to carry the troops to the battlefield safe from shrapnel and ambush. They may have wheels, tracks, or both as in the half-track. Examples include the American M113 (tracked), the British FV 432 (tracked), the Dutch/German Boxer MRAV (wheeled), the French VAB (wheeled), the Soviet BTR (wheeled), and the American M3 (half-tracked). [PARAGRAPH:2]Infantry Mobility Vehicle (IMV) is a modern term for a wheeled armoured personnel carrier (APC) which serves as a military patrol, reconnaissance or security vehicle.

[PARAGRAPH:2]An infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) is an armoured personnel carrier which allows the infantry to fight from inside, and can provide significant fire support. The first IFV was the Soviet BMP-1, which surprised the western intelligence analysts when it appeared in a military parade in 1967. [PARAGRAPH:2]Self-propelled artillery are artillery pieces which have been given their own integral transport by mounting them on tracked or wheeled chassis. They are usually armoured as well. The mobility provided allows artillery to keep up with the pace of armoured warfare, and gives them nominal protection from counter-battery or small arms fire. Like towed artillery, a battery of self-propelled guns must still set up in a relatively safe area to perform fire missions, but is able to relocate more quickly. [PARAGRAPH:2]Self-propelled anti-tank guns, or tank destroyers, are used primarily to provide antitank support for infantry or tank units, in defensive or withdrawal operations. They may mount a high-velocity anti-tank gun or sometimes an antitank guided missile launcher, or ATGM.

[PARAGRAPH:2]Infantry Mobility Vehicle (IMV) is a modern term for a wheeled armoured personnel carrier (APC) which serves as a military patrol, reconnaissance or security vehicle. The distinction between it and an armoured car being the ability to carry a unit of infantry. Modern examples include the Bushmaster IMV, Stryker Infantry Carrier Vehicle (ICV) and vehicles being fielded as part of the MRAP program. [PARAGRAPH:2]An infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) is an armoured personnel carrier which allows the infantry to fight from inside, and can provide significant fire support. The first IFV was the Soviet BMP-1, which surprised the western intelligence analysts when it appeared in a military parade in 1967. [PARAGRAPH:2]Self-propelled artillery are artillery pieces which have been given their own integral transport by mounting them on tracked or wheeled chassis. They are usually armoured as well. The mobility provided allows artillery to keep up with the pace of armoured warfare, and gives them nominal protection from counter-battery or small arms fire. Like towed artillery, a battery of self-propelled guns must still set up in a relatively safe area to perform fire missions, but is able to relocate more quickly. [PARAGRAPH:2]Self-propelled anti-tank guns, or tank destroyers, are used primarily to provide antitank support for infantry or tank units, in defensive or withdrawal operations. They may mount a high-velocity anti-tank gun or sometimes an antitank guided missile launcher, or ATGM. Tank destroyers cannot fulfill the many roles of tanks; they are much less flexible, and usually lacking in anti-infantry capability, but they are much less expensive to manufacture, maintain, and resupply than tanks.</German>
		<Italian>[TAB]An armoured vehicle is a military vehicle, protected by armour and armed with weapons. Most armored vehicles are equipped for driving in rugged terrain. Armoured fighting vehicles are classified according to their intended role on the battlefield and characteristics.

For example, armoured personnel carriers were generally replaced by infantry fighting vehicles in a very similar role, but the latter has some capabilities lacking in the former.

Though several configurations have been tried, particularly in the early experimental days of tank development, a standard, mature design configuration has since emerged to a generally accepted pattern. This features a main artillery gun, mounted in a fully rotating turret atop a tracked automotive hull, with various additional machine guns throughout.

		<English>[TAB]Motion Pictures is movie-making as an art and an industry, including its production techniques, its creative artists, and the distribution and exhibition of its products. The earliest experiments in photographing movement were made in the late 19th century. Notably, serial photographs of racehorses, intended to prove that all four hooves do leave the ground simultaneously, were obtained (c.1867) in California by Eadweard Muybridge and J. D. Isaacs by setting up a row of cameras with shutters tripped by wires. The first motion pictures made with a single camera were by E. J. Marey, a French physician, in the 1880s, in the course of his study of motion. [PARAGRAPH:2]In 1889 Thomas Edison and his staff developed the kinetograph, a camera using rolls of coated celluloid film, and the Kinetoscope, a device for peep-show viewing using photographs that flipped in sequence. Marketed in 1893, the Kinetoscope gained popularity in penny arcades, and experimentation turned to ways in which moving images might be shown to more than one person at a time. In France the Lumière brothers created the first projection device, the Cinématographe (1895). In the United States, similar machines, notably the Pantopticon and the Vitascope, were developed and first used in New York City in 1896. [PARAGRAPH:2]At first the screenings formed part of vaudeville shows and arcades, but in 1902 a Los Angeles shop that showed only moving pictures had great success; soon "movie houses" (converted shoprooms) sprang up all over the country. The first movie theater, complete with luxurious accessories and a piano, was built in Pittsburgh in 1905. A nickel was charged for admission, and the theater was called the nickelodeon. An industry developed to produce new material and the medium's potential for expressive ends began to assert itself. As business increased, the demand for product was met by many new companies incorporated to create the supply. The competition led to many innovations as each company tried to secure continued success and distinguish its product from the rest. Out of these efforts developed the star system, the establishment of dedicated "studios" where the films would be made, and the organization of the filmmaking process into interlocking crafts; the latter became current disciplines such as acting, writing, and directing.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The development of submarines for warfare was undertaken at the start of the 20th century in earnest. The idea had been attempted before, but nothing that proved to be militarily viable had been created. The power that was the most advanced win submarine warfare at the outbreak of World War I was Germany. Germany was aware that for sheer tonnage it could not compete with the British Navy, so attempted to employ a stealthy weapon that would not be as susceptible to the British warships. Germany also realized that Britain required prodigious amounts of produce from its empire, as well as being able to ship troops to and from Europe if it was to participate in a land war. Being able to disrupt these supply lines would significantly reduce Britain’s ability to fight. This was seen as Germany attacked convoys that sent goods from the Empire and America to Britain, and did manage to cause much disruption on the seas. The much vaunted British battleships were unable to do anything against these submersible ships. Britain did have its own submarine ships, but as Germany was a continental power there were far less targets available. Britain attempted to design a ship that could sail on top of the water and submerge like a submarine (the "K" ships), but were found to be next to useless on the surface, and required such a long time to submerge that they were easily destroyed or captured. After World War I, most of the powers bar Germany forgot the role that submarines excelled at, as well as the tactics that are best used against them; these had to be painfully re-learned in the next war. This led to the previous allies powers (France, America, Britain and Japan - an ally of Britain in World War I) viewing the submarine as a "proper" fleet ship that should be used to sink enemy battleships, whereas Germany used them again as raiders, where they excelled in Donitz's Wolf Packs.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Around the time of World War II, great leaps were made in the field of aviation. The military demands of the war necessitated the development of aircraft designed for long-range bombing, and for the transportation of troops and equipment. Although advances in aviation were made all over the world during this time, the Germans were particularly adept in the development of advanced flight technologies; there was particularly strong advancement in the field of rocket propulsion as this was the one area where the Treaties of Versailles after World War I had not forbidden military growth. In 1944, they developed the V-2, the first truly guided missile, capable of delivering 2000 pounds of explosives to targets nearly 200 miles away. The Germans also developed the Me 262, the first jet fighter plane, which was first used in 1945.

		<English>[TAB]A helicopter is an aircraft that is lifted and propelled by one or more horizontal rotors, each rotor consisting of two or more rotor blades. Helicopters are classified as rotorcraft or rotary-wing aircraft to distinguish them from fixed-wing aircraft because the helicopter derives its source of lift from the rotor blades rotating around a mast. As an aircraft, the primary advantages of the helicopter are due to the rotor blades that revolve through the air, providing lift without requiring the aircraft to move forward. This creates the ability for the helicopter to take off and land vertically without the need for runways. For this reason, helicopters are often used in congested or isolated areas where fixed-wing aircraft are not able to take off or land. The lift from the rotor also allows the helicopter to hover in one area and to do so more efficiently than other forms of vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft, allowing it to accomplish tasks that fixed-wing aircraft are unable to perform.</English>

In that test, Fessenden demonstrated depth sounding, underwater communications (Morse Code) and echo ranging (detected an iceberg at two miles (3 km) range).

By 1944, large-scale nuclear reactors were in operation for the production of plutonium, although the energy produced by these reactors was not used. Following World War II, increased efforts were turned toward the extensive use of nuclear power to produce electricity. [PARAGRAPH:2]Nuclear power plants use the radiant energy of a controlled nuclear reaction to heat water, converting it to steam to spin turbines that generate electricity. The major drawback to nuclear fission is the lack of a safe means of disposal for the waste produced by the reaction, which retains its lethal radioactivity for hundreds of years. Another hazard is the possibility of a malfunction in the reactor that could lead to a meltdown of the core. Despite massive safety precautions, human error and equipment failures can lead to devastating accidents such as the explosion at Chernobyl in 1986, in which at least 30 people were killed and thousands lost their homes and face possible long-term illness after exposure to near-lethal doses of radiation. Because of growing public concern, the development of new nuclear power plants has slowed as scientists search for viable solutions to these problems.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The turn of the 20th century brought the start of a revolution in physics. This revolution centered around the advent on quantum mechanics and special and general relativity, the two concepts that mark the advent of modern physics. Both of these theories would offer fundamental insights into the universe and the laws the govern it. Quantum mechanics would describe the microscopic nature of matter, while relativity would describe space and time. [PARAGRAPH:2]In 1900, Max Planck published his explanation of blackbody radiation. This equation assumed that radiators are quantized, which proved to be the opening argument in the edifice that would become quantum mechanics. By introducing discrete energy levels, Planck, Einstein, Niels Bohr, and others developed quantum theories to explain other anomalous experimental results like the photoelectric effect. The discovery of quantum mechanics in the early 20th century revolutionized physics, and quantum mechanics is fundamental to most areas of current research. [PARAGRAPH:2]In 1904, J. J. Thomson proposed the first model of the atom, known as the plum pudding model. In 1911, Ernest Rutherford deduced from scattering experiments the existence of a compact atomic nucleus, with positively charged constituents dubbed protons. The first quantum mechanical model of the atom, the Bohr model, was published in 1913 by Niels Bohr. Sir W. H. Bragg and his son Sir William Lawrence Bragg, also in 1913, began to unravel the arrangement of atoms in crystalline matter by the use of x-ray diffraction. Neutrons, the neutral nuclear constituents, were discovered in 1932 by James Chadwick. [PARAGRAPH:2]One of the most important concepts in modern physics and one which would help usher in quantum mechanics was proposed by Louis de Broglie. Broglie's 1922 doctoral thesis introduced his theory of electron waves. This included the wave-particle duality theory of matter, based on the work of Albert Einstein and Planck. This research culminated in the de Broglie hypothesis stating that any moving particle or object had an associated wave. De Broglie thus created a new field in physics, wave mechanics, uniting the physics of light and matter. Among the applications of this work has been the development of electron microscopes to get much better image resolution than optical ones, because of shorter wavelengths of electrons compared with photon. [PARAGRAPH:2]In 1915, Einstein extended special relativity to describe gravity with the general theory of relativity. One principal result of general relativity is the gravitational collapse into black holes, which was anticipated two centuries earlier, but elucidated by Robert Oppenheimer. Important exact solutions of Einstein's field equation were found by Karl Schwarzschild in 1915 and Roy Kerr only in 1963. One part of the theory of general relativity is Einstein's field equation. This describes how the stress-energy tensor creates curvature of spacetime and forms the basis of general relativity. Further work on Einstein's field equation produced results which predicted the Big Bang, black holes, and the expanding universe. Einstein believed in a static universe. He tried, and failed, to fix his equation to allow for this. In 1929, however, Edwin Hubble published his discovery that that the universe is expanding at a possibly exponential rate. This is the basis for understanding that the universe is expanding. Thus, the universe must have been smaller and therefore hotter in the past. In 1933 Karl Jansky at Bell Labs discovered the radio emission from the Milky Way, and thereby initiated the science of radio astronomy. By the 1940s, researchers like George Gamow proposed the Big Bang theory, evidence for which was discovered in 1964; Enrico Fermi and Fred Hoyle were among the doubters in the 1940s and 1950s. Hoyle had dubbed Gamow's theory the Big Bang in order to debunk it. Today, it is one of the principal results of cosmology.</English>

		<Italian>[TAB]The turn of the 20th century brought the start of a revolution in physics. This revolution centered around the advent on quantum mechanics and special and general relativity, the two concepts that mark the advent of modern physics. Both of these theories would offer fundamental insights into the universe and the laws the govern it. Quantum mechanics would describe the microscopic nature of matter, while relativity would describe space and time. [PARAGRAPH:2]In 1900, Max Planck published his explanation of blackbody radiation. This equation assumed that radiators are quantized, which proved to be the opening argument in the edifice that would become quantum mechanics. By introducing discrete energy levels, Planck, Einstein, Niels Bohr, and others developed quantum theories to explain other anomalous experimental results like the photoelectric effect. The discovery of quantum mechanics in the early 20th century revolutionized physics, and quantum mechanics is fundamental to most areas of current research. [PARAGRAPH:2]In 1904, J. J. Thomson proposed the first model of the atom, known as the plum pudding model. In 1911, Ernest Rutherford deduced from scattering experiments the existence of a compact atomic nucleus, with positively charged constituents dubbed protons. The first quantum mechanical model of the atom, the Bohr model, was published in 1913 by Niels Bohr. Sir W. H. Bragg and his son Sir William Lawrence Bragg, also in 1913, began to unravel the arrangement of atoms in crystalline matter by the use of x-ray diffraction. Neutrons, the neutral nuclear constituents, were discovered in 1932 by James Chadwick. [PARAGRAPH:2]One of the most important concepts in modern physics and one which would help usher in quantum mechanics was proposed by Louis de Broglie. Broglie's 1922 doctoral thesis introduced his theory of electron waves. This included the wave-particle duality theory of matter, based on the work of Albert Einstein and Planck. This research culminated in the de Broglie hypothesis stating that any moving particle or object had an associated wave. De Broglie thus created a new field in physics, wave mechanics, uniting the physics of light and matter. Among the applications of this work has been the development of electron microscopes to get much better image resolution than optical ones, because of shorter wavelengths of electrons compared with photon. [PARAGRAPH:2]In 1915, Einstein extended special relativity to describe gravity with the general theory of relativity. One principal result of general relativity is the gravitational collapse into black holes, which was anticipated two centuries earlier, but elucidated by Robert Oppenheimer. Important exact solutions of Einstein's field equation were found by Karl Schwarzschild in 1915 and Roy Kerr only in 1963. One part of the theory of general relativity is Einstein's field equation.

		<English>[TAB]Mercantilism, economic system of the major trading nations during the 16th, 17th, and 18th cent., based on the premise that national wealth and power were best served by increasing exports and collecting precious metals in return. It superseded the medieval feudal organization in Western Europe, especially in Holland, France, and England. The period 1500-1800 was one of religious and commercial wars, and large revenues were needed to maintain armies and pay the growing costs of civil government. [PARAGRAPH:2]Mercantilist nations were impressed by the fact that the precious metals, especially gold, were in universal demand as the ready means of obtaining other commodities; hence they tended to identify money with wealth. As the best means of acquiring bullion, foreign trade was favored above domestic trade, and manufacturing or processing, which provided the goods for foreign trade, was favored at the expense of the extractive industries (e.g., agriculture). [PARAGRAPH:2]State action, an essential feature of the mercantile system, was used to accomplish its purposes. Under a mercantilist policy a nation sought to sell more than it bought so as to accumulate bullion. Besides bullion, raw materials for domestic manufacturers were also sought, and duties were levied on the importation of such goods in order to provide revenue for the government. The state exercised much control over economic life, chiefly through corporations and trading companies. Production was carefully regulated with the object of securing goods of high quality and low cost, thus enabling the nation to hold its place in foreign markets. Treaties were made to obtain exclusive trading privileges, and the commerce of colonies was exploited for the benefit of the mother country. In England mercantilist policies were effective in creating a skilled industrial population and a large shipping industry. Through a series of Navigation Acts England finally destroyed the commerce of Holland, its chief rival. As the classical economists were later to point out, however, even a successful mercantilist policy was not likely to be beneficial, because it produced an oversupply of money and, with it, serious inflation. Mercantilist ideas did not decline until the coming of the Industrial Revolution and of laissez-faire. Henry VIII, Elizabeth I, and Oliver Cromwell conformed their policies to mercantilism. In France its chief exponent was Jean Baptiste Colbert.</English>

When an electric current passes through most conductors, part of that current is lost due to resistance, which varies depending on the conducting material and the ambient temperature. Some conductors, when cooled to temperatures near absolute zero, lose all resistance to current. These are known as superconductors. Because no energy is lost to resistance, superconductors can lead to a wide variety of practical uses. These include super-fast computers, powerful electromagnetic fields strong enough to contain fusion reactions, and the completely efficient generation and transmission of electrical power. Although the extremely low temperatures necessary to produce superconductivity have limited its uses thus far, recent developments hint that some unusual materials may be super conductive even at room temperatures. The isolation and large-scale production of these materials could lead to a new revolution in the field of electronics.</English>

Realism also refers to a mid-19th century cultural movement with its roots in France, where it was a very popular art form around the mid to late 1800s. It came about with the introduction of photography - a new visual source that created a desire for people to produce things that look “objectively real”. Realism was heavily against romanticism, a genre dominating French literature and artwork in the late 18th and early 19th century.

		<English>[TAB]Moral dualism is the belief of the coexistence (in eastern and naturalistic religions) or conflict (in western religions) between the "benevolent" and the "malignant". Most religious systems have some form of moral dualism - in western religions, for instance, a conflict between good and evil. [PARAGRAPH:2]Like ditheism/bitheism, moral dualism does not imply the absence of monist or monotheistic principles. Moral dualism simply implies that there are two moral opposites at work, independent of any interpretation of what might be "moral" and - unlike ditheism/bitheism - independent of how these may be represented. [PARAGRAPH:2]For example, Mazdaism (Mazdaen Zoroastrianism) is both dualistic and monotheistic (but not monist) since in that philosophy God—the Creator—is purely good, and the antithesis—which is also uncreated—is an absolute one. Zurvanism (Zurvanite Zoroastrianism), Manichaeism and Mandaeism, are representative of dualistic and monist philosophies since each has a supreme and transcendental First Principle from which the two equal-but-opposite entities then emanate. This is also true for the lesser-known Christian gnostic religions, such as Bogomils, Catharism, etc. More complex forms of monist dualism also exist, for instance in Hermeticism, where Nous "thought" - that is described to have created man - brings forth both good and evil, depending on whether it receives prompting from God or from the demons.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Glassblowing is a glassforming technique that involves inflating the molten glass into a glass blob with the aid of the blowpipe, or blow tube. A person who blows glass is called a glassblower, glassmith, or gaffer. [PARAGRAPH:2]As a novel glass forming technique created in the middle of the first century B.C., glassblowing exploited a working property of glass which was previously unknown to the glassworkers – inflation. Inflation refers to the expansion of a molten blob of glass by introducing a small amount of air to it. This property is based on the liquid structure of glass where the atoms are held together by strong chemical bonds in a disordered and random network, therefore molten glass is viscous enough to be blown and gradually hardens as it loses heat. n order to increase the stiffness of the molten glass, which in turn facilitates the process of blowing, there is a subtle change in the composition of glass. With reference to their studies of the ancient glass assemblages from Sepphoris of Israel, Fischer and McCray postulated that the concentration of natron, which acts as flux in glass, is slightly lower in blown vessels than those manufactured by casting. Lower concentration of natron would have allowed the glass to be stiffer for blowing. A full range of glassblowing techniques was developed within decades of its invention.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Perspective (from Latin perspicere, to see through) in the graphic arts, such as drawing, is an approximate representation, on a flat surface (such as paper), of an image as it is perceived by the eye. [PARAGRAPH:2]Before perspective, paintings and drawings typically sized objects and characters according to their spiritual or thematic importance, not with distance. Especially in Medieval art, art was meant to be read as a group of symbols, rather than seen as a coherent picture. The only method to show distance was by overlapping characters. Overlapping alone made poor drawings of architecture; medieval paintings of cities are a hodgepodge of lines in every direction. With the exception of dice, heraldry typically ignores perspective in the treatment of charges, though sometimes in later centuries charges are specified as in perspective. [PARAGRAPH:2]Perspective perhaps first entered mainstream artistic use around the 5th century B.C. in ancient Greece in the subject of skenographia: using a flat panel on a stage to give the illusion of depth. The philosophers Anaxagoras and Democritus worked out geometric theories of perspective for use with skenographia. Alcibiades had paintings in his house designed based on skenographia, thus this art was not confined merely to the stage. Euclid's Optics introduced a mathematical theory of perspective; however, there is some debate over the extent to which Euclid's perspective coincides with a modern mathematical definition of perspective. [PARAGRAPH:2]A clearly modern optical basis of perspective was given in 1021, when Alhazen, an Iraqi physicist and mathematician, in his Book of Optics, explained that light projects conically into the eye. This was, theoretically, enough to translate objects convincingly onto a painting, but Alhalzen was concerned only with optics, not with painting. Conical translations are mathematically difficult, so a drawing constructed using them would be incredibly time consuming. [PARAGRAPH:2]In about 1415, Filippo Brunelleschi demonstrated the geometrical method of perspective, used today by artists, by painting the outlines of various Florentine buildings onto a mirror. When the building's outline was continued, he noticed that all of the lines converged on the horizon line. According to Vasari, he then set up a demonstration of his painting of the Baptistry in the incomplete doorway of the Duomo. He had the viewer look through a small hole on the back of the painting, facing the Baptistry. He would then set up a mirror, facing the viewer, which reflected his painting. To the viewer, the painting of the Baptistry and the Baptistry itself were nearly indistinguishable. [PARAGRAPH:2]Soon after, nearly every artist in Florence used geometrical perspective in their paintings, notably Donatello, who started sculpting elaborate checkerboard floors into the simple manger portrayed in the birth of Christ. Although hardly historically accurate, these checkerboard floors obeyed the primary laws of geometrical perspective: all lines converged to a vanishing point, and the rate at which the horizontal lines receded into the distance was graphically determined. This became an integral part of Quattrocento art. Not only was perspective a way of showing depth, it was also a new method of composing a painting. Paintings began to show a single, unified scene, rather than a combination of several.</English>

Often an oil, such as linseed was boiled with a resin such as pine resin or even frankincense, these were called 'varnishes' and were prized for their body and gloss. Other oils occasionally used include poppyseed oil, walnut oil, and safflower oil. These oils give various properties to the oil paint, such as less yellowing or different drying times. Certain differences are also visible in the sheen of the paints depending on the oil. Painters often use different oils in the same painting depending on specific pigments and effects desired. The paints themselves also develop a particular feel depending on the media.</English>

Essentially, inventiveness is the ability to take one or more newly discovered concepts and find a way to put them to practical use. The earliest inventions of mankind date back to ancient stone and metal tools used for hunting, digging, and other everyday tasks. After writing allowed the ideas of various civilizations to be exchanged and studied, mankind's inventions became increasingly more useful and innovative.

The one major advantage that hand guns offered was that virtually no training was required to be proficient in their use, as compared to the amount of time that training to use a longbow required. To ignite the gunpowder in these simple guns, a burning taper (or match) was applied to a hole in the gun where gunpowder would be poured. Although this ensured that gun would fire, it added to the slowness of the firearm, as well as rendering the gun useless in wet weather. So although it was a useful tool on the battlefield, it was clear that there were many areas where advances would be made.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Jurisprudence, study of the nature and the origin and development of law. It is variously regarded as a branch of ethics or of sociology. Many of the major systematic philosophers (e.g., Aristotle, St. Thomas Aquinas, and Kant) have expounded jurisprudential theories. Before the 19th cent. most jurisprudents adhered to natural law, which maintained that sound legal doctrine was derivable only from a supposed law of nature established by divine ordinance. The natural-law school did not deny that the details of legal regulation depended upon the will of the sovereign. However, the positivist, or analytical, school, which first became important in the late 18th cent., insisted that law was entirely a matter of sovereign decree, distinct from morality and theology. Among important 19th-century trends was the view, represented by Savigny, that a people's legal system expressed the national spirit. In the mid-19th cent. many jurisprudents attempted to avoid what they felt were theoretical preconceptions and to demonstrate a uniform evolution from primitive times to modern industrialized society. Other thinkers were skeptical of evolutionary explanations and sought the basic principles underlying all systems of law in various fields, including economics and psychology. Among the more important legal thinkers in the United States have been Learned Hand, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and Roscoe Pound. [PARAGRAPH:2]Civil law, as used in this article, a modern legal system based upon Roman law, as distinguished from common law. Civil law is based on written legal codes, a hallmark of the Roman legal system, in which disputes were settled by reference to a written legal code arrived at through legislation, edicts, and the like; common law is based on the precedents created by judicial decisions over time. The tendency in civil law is to create a unified legal system by working out with maximum precision the conclusions to be drawn from basic principles. The civil law judge is bound by the provisions of the written law. The traditional civil law decision states the applicable provision from the code or from a relevant statute, and the judgment is based upon that provision.</English>

The tendency in civil law is to create a unified legal system by working out with maximum precision the conclusions to be drawn from basic principles. The civil law judge is bound by the provisions of the written law. The traditional civil law decision states the applicable provision from the code or from a relevant statute, and the judgment is based upon that provision.</Spanish>

		<English>[TAB]Social contract, agreement or covenant by which men are said to have abandoned the "state of nature" to form the society in which they now live. The theory of such a contract, first formulated by the English philosophers Thomas Hobbes (in the Leviathan, 1651) and John Locke, assumes that men at first lived in a state of anarchy in which there was no society, no government, and no organized coercion of the individual by the group. Hobbes maintained that by the social contract men had surrendered their natural liberties in order to enjoy the order and safety of the organized state. Locke made the social contract the basis of his advocacy of popular sovereignty, the idea that the monarch or government must reflect the will of the people. Like Locke, the French philosopher Jean Jacques Rousseau, in Le Contrat social (1762), found the general will a means of establishing reciprocal rights and duties, privileges, and responsibilities as a basis of the state. Similar ideas were used as a justification for both the American and the French revolutions in the 18th cent. Thomas Jefferson held that the preservation of certain natural rights was an essential part of the social contract, and that "consent of the governed" was fundamental to any exercise of governmental power. Although historically important, the theory as a basis of society and the state has generally been discarded by modern social and political scientists. [PARAGRAPH:2]Rousseau's political philosophy assumes that there really is a common good, and that the general will is not merely an ideal, but can, under the right conditions, be actual. And it is under such conditions, with the rule of the general will, that Rousseau sees our full development taking place, when "The advantages of a state of nature would be combined with the advantages of social life." Because he had such faith in the existence of the common good and the rightness of the general will, Rousseau was extreme in the sanctions he was willing to allow for its achievement: "If anyone, after publicly recognizing these dogmas, behaves as if he does not believe them, let him be punished by death: He has committed the worst of all crimes, that of lying before the law." Finally, Rousseau advocates a civil religion. Rousseau's thought sometimes rings of Calvinist Geneva, even though he reacted against its vision of humanity and had his books burned by its ecclesiastic authorities.</English>

Although these compounds release a large amount of energy, to start the reaction, often an initiator is required, something that is far more unstable, but by itself does not contain enough energy in a small enough space.

		<English>[TAB]A human-machine interface or a brain-computer interface (BCI), sometimes called a direct neural interface or a brain-machine interface, is a direct communication pathway between a human or animal brain (or brain cell culture) and an external device. In one-way BCIs, computers either accept commands from the brain or send signals to it (for example, to restore vision) but not both. Two-way BCIs would allow brains and external devices to exchange information in both directions. [PARAGRAPH:2]Research on BCIs began in the 1970s, but it wasn't until the mid-1990s that the first working experimental implants in humans appeared. Following years of animal experimentation, early working implants in humans now exist, designed to restore damaged hearing, sight and movement. The common thread throughout the research is the remarkable cortical plasticity of the brain, which often adapts to BCIs, treating prostheses controlled by implants as natural limbs. With recent advances in technology and knowledge, pioneering researchers could now conceivably attempt to produce BCIs that augment human functions rather than simply restoring them, previously only the realm of science fiction.</English>

		<English>[TAB]A stone tool is, in the most general sense, any tool made of stone. Stone tools may be made of chipped stone or ground stone. A person who makes chipped stone implements is called a flintknapper. In addition to tools, many minerals were used to make arrow heads and spear points. [PARAGRAPH:2]Chipped stone tools are made from cryptocrystalline materials such as chert, radiolarite, chalcedony, basalt, quartzite and obsidian via a process known as lithic reduction. One simple form of reduction is to strike stone flakes from a nucleus (core) of material using a hammerstone or similar hard hammer fabricator. If the goal of the reduction strategy is to produce flakes, the remnant lithic core may be discarded once it has become too small to use. In some strategies, however, a flintknapper reduces the core to a rough unifacial or bifacial preform, which is further reduced using soft hammer flaking techniques or by pressure flaking the edges. More complex forms of reduction include the production of highly standardized blades, which can then be fashioned into a variety of tools such as scrapers, knives, sickles and microliths. In general terms, chipped stone tools are nearly ubiquitous in all pre-metal-using societies because they are easily manufactured, the tool stone is usually plentiful, and they are easy to transport and sharpen.</English>

Introduced about 1630, the flintlock rapidly replaced earlier firearm-ignition technologies, such as the matchlock and wheellock mechanisms. It continued to be in common use for over two centuries, replaced by percussion cap and, later, cartridge-based systems in the early-to-mid 19th century. The Model 1840 U.S. musket was the last flintlock firearm produced for the U.S. military although there is some evidence that obsolete flintlocks were still seeing action in the earliest days of the American Civil War. In fact, during the first year of the war, the Army of Tennessee (Confederacy) had over 2,000 flintlock muskets in service. While technologically obsolete, flintlock firearms have enjoyed a renaissance among black powder shooting enthusiasts and many fine flintlock rifles and pistols are still being made today.</English>

The Model 1840 U.S. musket was the last flintlock firearm produced for the U.S. military although there is some evidence that obsolete flintlocks were still seeing action in the earliest days of the American Civil War.

		<English>[TAB]The French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars that followed revolutionized military strategy. The impact of this period was still to be felt in the American Civil War and the early phases of World War I. [PARAGRAPH:2]With the advent of cheap small arms and the rise of the drafted citizen soldier, armies grew rapidly in size to become massed formations. This necessitated dividing the army first into divisions and later into corps. Along with divisions came divisional artillery; light-weight, mobile cannon with great range and firepower.

[PARAGRAPH:2]Napoleon I of France took advantage of these developments to pursue a brutally effective "strategy of annihilation" (see scorched earth) that terrorized the populace and cared little for the mathematical perfection of the geometric strategy. Napoleon invariably sought to achieve decision in battle, with the sole aim of utterly destroying his opponent, usually achieving success through superior manoeuvre. As ruler and general he dealt with the grand strategy as well as the operational strategy, making use of political and economic measures. [PARAGRAPH:2]While not the originator of the methods he used, Napoleon very effectively combined the relatively superior maneuver and battle stages into one event.

		<English>[TAB]The principle employed in using a screw propeller is used in sculling. It is part of the skill of propelling a Venetian gondola but was used in a less refined way in other parts of Europe and probably elsewhere. [PARAGRAPH:2]In sculling, a single blade is moved through an arc, from side to side taking care to keep presenting the blade to the water at the effective angle. The innovation introduced with the screw propeller was the extension of that arc through more than 360 degrees by attaching the blade to a rotating shaft. In practice, there has to be more than one blade so as to balance the forces involved. The exception is the Single-blade propeller system. [PARAGRAPH:2]The origin of the actual screw propeller starts, in the West, with Archimedes, who used a screw to lift water for irrigation and bailing boats, so famously that it became known as the Archimedes screw. It was probably an application of spiral movement in space (spirals were a special study of Archimedes) to a hollow segmented water-wheel used for irrigation by Egyptians for centuries. Leonardo da Vinci adopted the principle to drive his theoretical helicopter, sketches of which involved a large canvas screw overhead. [PARAGRAPH:2]In 1784, J. P. Paucton proposed a gyrocopter-like aircraft using similar screws for both lift and propulsion. At about the same time, James Watt proposed using screws to propel boats, although he did not use them for his steam engines. This was not his own invention, though; Toogood and Hays had patented it a century earlier, and it had become an uncommon use as a means of propelling boats since that time. [PARAGRAPH:2]By 1827 Robert Welch had invented a screw propeller which had multiple blades fastened around a conical base; this new method of propulsion allowed steam ships to travel at much greater speeds without using sails thereby making ocean travel faster. Propellers remained extremely inefficient and little-utilized until 1835, when Francis Pettit Smith discovered a new way of building propellers. Up to that time, propellers were literally screws, of considerable length.

A plurality means that a winning candidate has to win more votes than any other candidate in the race, but does not necessarily require a majority of the votes cast. While existing representative democracies hold such elections to choose representatives, in theory other methods, such as sortition (more closely aligned with direct democracy), could be used instead. Also, representatives sometimes hold the power to select other representatives, presidents, or other officers of government (indirect representation).</Spanish>

		<English>[TAB]English inventor Sir Samuel Morland allegedly used gunpowder to drive water pumps in the 17th century. For more conventional, reciprocating internal combustion engines. the fundamental theory for two-stroke engines was established by Sadi Carnot, France, 1824, whilst the American Samuel Morey received a patent on April 1, 1826. Sir Dugald Clark (1854 – 1932) designed the first two-stroke engine in 1878 and patented it in England in 1881. Automotive production has used a range of energy-conversion systems. These include electric, steam, solar, turbine, rotary, and piston-type internal combustion engines. The petrol internal combustion engine, operating on a four-stroke Otto cycle, has been the most successful for automobiles, while diesel engines are used for trucks and buses. Karl Benz was one of the leaders in the development of new engines. In 1878 he began to work on new designs. He concentrated his efforts on creating a reliable gas two-stroke engine that was more powerful, based on Nikolaus Otto's design of the four-stroke engine. Karl Benz showed his real genius, however, through his successive inventions registered while designing what would become the production standard for his two-stroke engine. Benz was granted a patent for it in 1879. [PARAGRAPH:2]In 1896, Karl Benz was granted a patent for his design of the first engine with horizontally-opposed pistons. Many BMW motorcycles use this engine type. His design created an engine in which the corresponding pistons move in horizontal cylinders and reach top dead center simultaneously, thus automatically balancing each other with respect to their individual momentums. Engines of this design are often referred to as flat engines because of their shape and lower profile. They must have an even number of cylinders and six, four or two cylinder flat engines have all been common. The most well-known engine of this type is probably the Volkswagen beetle engine. Engines of this type continue to be a common design principle for high performance aero engines (for propellor driven aircraft) and, engines used by automobile producers such as Porsche and Subaru.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Hydroponics is the science of growing vegetables in nutrient solutions rather than in soil. The earliest references to hydroponics date back to the seventeenth century, and while notable advances in research were seen over the following centuries, the first practical applications of hydroponics did not appear until the early twentieth century, and mass adoption didn't occur until the middle of the twenty-first century. There are two primary benefits to growing plants in nutrient solutions rather than in soil: the nutrient solution can be sterilized (unlike soil), greatly reducing the occurrence of disease and pests in the plants, and a much greater number of crops can be grown in a small area. [PARAGRAPH:2]The primary downside to this method of cultivation is that it requires a fair degree of technical know-how to install and maintain the complicated machines necessary to keep the "scum-ponds" healthy and productive. However, once education levels improved in rural populations across the world, this was no longer an impediment, and the practice has since spread rapidly, greatly increasing the world's food supply.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Humans have used biological warfare against each other for untold centuries. The earliest efforts were crude - throwing diseased corpses into cities under siege, giving the blankets of plague victims to unsuspecting natives, and so forth - but effective. Biological warfare was outlawed on Earth in the twentieth century, but that didn't stop a lot of countries and terrorist organizations from continuing to research and refine such weapons - "just in case." [PARAGRAPH:2]The biggest drawbacks to such weaponry remains the difficulty of delivering a large enough dose to be immediately effective, as well as figuring out a way to ensure that the disease doesn't turn around and wipe your side out as well as your enemy. While the first difficulty has been somewhat addressed with the creation of super viruses capable of surviving being dispersed from a missile warhead to cover a large area, the latter remains somewhat problematic: the new viruses are designed to be short-lived and to burn themselves out after a few days or weeks, but like all other viruses they are capable of mutation - perhaps into something far more persistent and easily spreadable - so the risks remain extremely high. Only the most foolish nation would use such a weapon except in the direst of needs.</English>
		<French>[TAB]Les humains utilisent des armes biologiques depuis des si&#232;cles.

La guerre biologique fut interdite sur Terre au vingti&#232;me si&#232;cle, mais cela n'emp&#234;cha pas un grand nombre de pays ou d'organisations terroristes de continuer &#224; d&#233;velopper des armes biologiques "au cas o&#249;". [PARAGRAPH:2]Les deux plus grands inconv&#233;nients d'un tel arsenal sont, d'une part, la difficult&#233; de r&#233;pandre une dose assez importante pour &#234;tre efficace et, d'autre part, le risque d'en subir soi-m&#234;me les effets. Le premier probl&#232;me a pu &#234;tre contourn&#233; par la cr&#233;ation de super virus embarqu&#233;s &#224; bord de missiles et dispers&#233;s au-dessus de larges territoires, mais le second reste insoluble. En effet, les nouveaux virus sont con&#231;us pour ne vivre que quelques jours ou quelques semaines mais ils sont, comme tous les virus, sujets &#224; des mutations qui peuvent les rendre plus r&#233;sistants ou plus contagieux. Toute nation qui entreprendrait d'utiliser une telle arme prendrait le risque de provoquer la fin de l'humanit&#233;.</French>
		<German>[TAB]Schon seit unz&#228;hligen Jahrhunderten haben sich die Menschen die biologische Kriegsf&#252;hrung zunutze gemacht, um sich gegenseitig zu bek&#228;mpfen. Die ersten Angriffe dieser Art waren h&#246;chst barbarisch - so wurden beispielsweise verseuchte Leichen in belagerte St&#228;dte geworfen, Decken von Pestopfern an arglose Einheimische verteilt und so weiter - aber dennoch effizient. Im 20. Jahrhundert war die biologische Kriegsf&#252;hrung schlie&#223;lich weltweit ge&#228;chtet, trotzdem lie&#223;en sich viele L&#228;nder und terroristische Vereinigungen nicht davon abhalten, weiterhin entsprechende Waffen zu erforschen und zu entwickeln - "nur f&#252;r den Fall". [PARAGRAPH:2]Die gr&#246;&#223;te Schwierigkeit beim Einsatz dieser Art von Waffen ist, eine hinreichend gro&#223;e Dosis freizusetzen, damit der biologische Kampfstoff sofort wirkt, gleichzeitig aber auch sicherzustellen, dass er sich nur gegen den Feind, nicht aber gegen die eigenen Reihen richtet. Das erste Problem wurde zum Teil durch die Entwicklung von Superviren gel&#246;st, die mittels eines Sprengkopfes freigesetzt werden und dann ein gro&#223;es Areal befallen, die zweite Problematik bleibt aber nach wie vor bestehen: Die neuen Viren besitzen lediglich eine begrenzte Lebensdauer und verlieren nach ein paar Tagen oder Wochen ihre Wirkung, aber wie alle anderen Viren sind auch sie in der Lage zu mutieren - m&#246;glicherweise sogar eine deutlich h&#246;here Widerstands- oder Ausbreitungsf&#228;higkeit zu entwickeln - so dass das Risiko auch f&#252;r die Reihen des Angreifers extrem hoch bleibt. Nur eine v&#246;llig irrsinnige Nation w&#252;rde eine derartige Waffe in einem anderen als dem schlimmsten Fall einsetzen.</German>

La guerra biologica fu bandita sulla Terra nel ventesimo secolo, ma ci&#242; non imped&#236; a molte nazioni e organizzazioni terroristiche di continuare la ricerca e affinare tali armi...

[PARAGRAPH:2]Lo svantaggio maggiore di tali armi &#232; la difficolt&#224; di usare una dose abbastanza grande da essere immediatamente efficace, cos&#236; come di trovare un modo per assicurarsi che la malattia non si "rivolti contro" ed elimini completamente le tue truppe, oltre a quelle del nemico. Mentre il primo problema &#232; stato in qualche modo risolto con la creazione di super-virus in grado di sopravvivere alla diffusione tramite missile, per coprire un'area molto grande, il secondo rimane scottante: i nuovi virus sono progettati per avere una vita molto breve e morire dopo pochi giorni o settimane, ma come tutti i virus sono in grado di mutare, magari in qualcosa di pi&#249; persistente e di facile diffusione, quindi i rischi rimangono molto alti.

And then only if one uses the term "perfected" in the loosest sense. After much research it became possible to create a physical clone of a human being, identical to the original model down to the smallest detail; however, the clones remain frustratingly incapable of rational thought. All attempts to educate these creatures have failed miserably, and the "smartest" clone remains little more than a drooling moron whose needs must be constantly attended to. So while clones remain excellent organ and limb donors, up until recently little else could be done with them. [PARAGRAPH:2]Recent scientific advances have allowed clones to be equipped with sophisticated computer systems capable of controlling the clones' movement. While the computers are not yet sophisticated enough to allow for the creation of "clone warriors," the zombie-like beings are capable of performing simple, repetitive actions like building roads, tilling farmland, and so forth, doing so more efficiently than purely human workers.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Aquaculture is the practice of cultivating the produce of water for consumption. Humans have been harvesting the bounty of the seas for all of history; however, as human population has grown exponentially, by the late twentieth century, much greater emphasis has been placed on so-called "sustainable" aquaculture.  Indeed the Treaty of Iceland, signed in 2033, mandated that, "No fish or mammal may be harvested from the ocean unless an equal or greater number of the same species are released into the wild at the same time." Unfortunately, with the collapse of the One World Government this treaty lost much of its efficacy, and the world's once-boundless supply of food is again under grave and imminent peril. [PARAGRAPH:2]Facing this dwindling supply of animal protein, aquaculture has focused upon the cultivation of oceanic vegetation like kelp and seaweed. Although plentiful, the resulting food has met with mixed reviews: while certain island and coastal cultures claim that these foods are delicacies, the rest of humanity appears to be in general agreement that they taste "like salty rubber, but not as good."</English>

Mais avec la croissance exponentielle de la population humaine, la fin du vingti&#232;me si&#232;cle a vu appara&#238;tre les besoins d'une aquaculture viable. Ainsi, le Trait&#233; d'Islande, ratifi&#233; en 2033, stipulait : "Aucun poisson ou mammif&#232;re ne peut &#234;tre extrait des mers ou des oc&#233;ans, &#224; moins qu'une quantit&#233; &#233;quivalente de la m&#234;me esp&#232;ce ne soit rendue &#224; la vie sauvage dans le m&#234;me temps." Malheureusement, depuis la chute du Gouvernement Mondial, le trait&#233; est tomb&#233; en d&#233;su&#233;tude et la faune marine est &#224; nouveau menac&#233;e d'extinction.[PARAGRAPH:2]Pour faire face &#224; la p&#233;nurie de prot&#233;ines animales, l'aquaculture s'est concentr&#233;e sur l'exploitation de cultures v&#233;g&#233;tales oc&#233;aniques comme le varech et les algues. Bien que tr&#232;s abondante, cette nourriture rencontre un succ&#232;s mitig&#233; : certaines populations c&#244;ti&#232;res se r&#233;jouissent de cette r&#233;volution alimentaire mais le reste de l'humanit&#233; semble s'accorder &#224; penser que "&#231;a a un go&#251;t de caoutchouc sal&#233;, en moins bon".</French>

Im Wesentlichen wurde im Rahmen des Abkommens von Island aus dem Jahr 2033 beschlossen, dass "kein Fisch oder S&#228;ugetier dem Meer entnommen werden darf, wenn nicht gleichzeitig dieselbe oder eine h&#246;here Anzahl derselben Spezies in die Wildnis entlassen wird". Ungl&#252;cklicherweise wurde dieses Abkommen nach dem Zerfall der Weltregierung weitgehend von den Nationen ignoriert, so dass die einst grenzenlosen Nahrungsvorr&#228;te der Erde mittlerweile abermals extrem und unmittelbar gef&#228;hrdet sind. [PARAGRAPH:2]Angesichts des schwindenden Nachschubs an tierischen Proteinen konzentriert sich die Aquakultur nun auf die Kultivierung ozeanischer Vegetation wie Seetang und Algen. Dadurch ist die Nahrungsversorgung zwar wieder gesichert, diese Art Lebensmittel an sich wird jedoch durchaus unterschiedlich bewertet: W&#228;hrend bestimmte Insel- und K&#252;stenkulturen die so gewonnene Nahrung als Delikatesse betrachten, scheint der Rest der Menschheit allgemein darin &#252;bereinzustimmen, dass sie "wie salziges Gummi, nur noch schlechter" schmeckt.</German>

In 1989 two scientists claimed to have created a cold fusion reaction, but their claims were disputed by other scientist who could not duplicate their results. And even when the first verifiable cold fusion reaction was documented many decades later, the size of the reactor necessary and the small amount of power it generated made cold fusion totally inefficient for common use. It would be years before a practical cold fusion generator would be created. [PARAGRAPH:2]Once created, the cold fusion generator had the capacity to change human existence, creating cheap, near-pollution-free energy for all. Unfortunately, however, like so many other potentially beneficial technologies recently discovered, cold fusion technology has been appropriated and classified by the military, used almost exclusively to create power plants for ever larger and more destructive weapons platforms. In the meantime humanity has had to continue to survive on ever-dwindling and highly-polluting energy sources like coal, oil, and uranium. </English>

		<German>[TAB]Die Kaltfusion - eine kontrollierbare Fusionsreaktion, die in etwa bei Raumtemperatur stattfindet - wurde lange als der "Heilige Gral" der modernen Physik betrachtet. Im Jahr 1989 gaben zwei Wissenschaftler vor, eine Kaltfusionsreaktion erzeugt zu haben, allerdings wurden ihre Behauptungen von anderen Wissenschaftlern, welche die angeblich erzielten Ergebnisse nicht rekonstruieren konnten, widerlegt. Die erste nachweisbare Kaltfusionsreaktion wurde viele Jahrzehnte sp&#228;ter dokumentiert, erwies sich aber wegen der enormen Dimensionen des ben&#246;tigten Reaktors und der geringen erzeugten Energiemenge als unbrauchbar. Ein wirklich praktisch einsetzbarer Kaltfusionsgenerator wurde erst Jahre sp&#228;ter gebaut. [PARAGRAPH:2]Die Kapazit&#228;ten dieses neuen Kaltfusionsgenerators w&#228;ren durchaus geeignet, um die Lebensumst&#228;nde der Menschen grundlegend zu ver&#228;ndern, denn er erzeugt nicht nur preiswerte, sondern auch nahezu schadstofffreie Energie zur allgemeinen Verwendung. Leider wird die Kaltfusionstechnologie jedoch wie so viele andere fortschrittliche Technologien der j&#252;ngeren Vergangenheit gr&#246;&#223;tenteils von milit&#228;rischen Organen vereinnahmt und somit fast ausschlie&#223;lich zur Speisung von Kraftwerken verwendet, welche die Produktion noch gr&#246;&#223;erer und vernichtenderer Waffen erm&#246;glichen. Aus diesem Grund bleibt den Menschen nichts anderes &#252;brig, als ihr &#220;berleben auch weiterhin durch zusehends knapper werdende und h&#246;chst umweltsch&#228;dliche Energiequellen wie Kohle, &#214;l und Uran zu sichern. </German>

Nel 1989 due scienziati affermarono di aver creato una reazione di fusione a freddo, ma le loro dichiarazioni furono confutate da altri scienziati che non riuscirono a riprodurre l'esperimento. Anche quando venne documentata la prima fusione a freddo verificabile, molti decenni dopo, le dimensioni del reattore necessario e la scarsa quantit&#224; di energia creata resero la fusione a freddo totalmente inefficace per l'uso comune. Sarebbero passati anni prima della creazione del primo reattore per la fusione a freddo pratico. [PARAGRAPH:2]Una volta creato, il reattore per la fusione a freddo riusc&#236; a cambiare l'esistenza umana, creando energia gratuita e quasi totalmente non inquinante per tutti. Sfortunatamente, per&#242;, come tante altre tecnologie potenzialmente benefiche scoperte di recente, la tecnologia per la fusione a freddo &#232; stata confiscata e classificata top secret dai militari, che la usano quasi esclusivamente per creare fonti di energia per armi sempre pi&#249; devastanti.

		<English>[TAB]Cybernetics is the study of communication and control in complex systems - human, animal, insect, or machine. (The word "cybernetics" is taken from a Greek word that means "the art of steering.") The fields of study within this broad subject run from examinations of how social structures - beehives, cities - react to, store, and pass on information, to how humans can best interface with the ever-more-important machines that increasingly affect our world. [PARAGRAPH:2]In the early twenty-first century, cybernetics became increasingly interested in human prosthetics, creating ever-more functional and useful replacements for lost limbs and organs. The most exciting breakthrough came when a team in Switzerland successfully transplanted a human brain into a fully-functional humanoid robot, creating the first true "cyborg" in history. And while the experiment was not a total success - the cyborg unfortunately went insane and killed the entire research team within moments after being awakened - the speed, skill and dexterity with which the cyborg dispatched the engineers were indeed quite impressive. Further experiments with cyborgs have since been limited to human clones, which are far less prone to psychosis.</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_TECH_FUEL_CELLS_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB]A fuel cell is an electrochemical energy conversion device. It produces electricity from various external quantities of fuel (on the anode side) and an oxidant (on the cathode side). These react in the presence of an electrolyte. Generally, the reactants flow in and reaction products flow out while the electrolyte remains in the cell. Fuel cells can operate virtually continuously as long as the necessary flows are maintained. [PARAGRAPH:2]Fuel cells are different from batteries in that they consume reactant, which must be replenished, whereas batteries store electrical energy chemically in a closed system. Additionally, while the electrodes within a battery react and change as a battery is charged or discharged, a fuel cell's electrodes are catalytic and relatively stable. Many combinations of fuel and oxidant are possible. A hydrogen cell uses hydrogen as fuel and oxygen as oxidant. Other fuels include hydrocarbons and alcohols. Other oxidants include air, chlorine and chlorine dioxide.[PARAGRAPH:2]The principle of the fuel cell was discovered by German scientist Christian Friedrich Sch&#246;nbein in 1838 and published in the January 1839 edition of the "Philosophical Magazine". Based on this work, the first fuel cell was developed by Welsh scientist Sir William Robert Grove in 1843. The fuel cell he made used similar materials to today's phosphoric-acid fuel cell. In 1955, W. Thomas Grubb, a chemist working for the General Electric Company (GE), further modified the original fuel cell design by using a sulphonated polystyrene ion-exchange membrane as the electrolyte. Three years later another GE chemist, Leonard Niedrach, devised a way of depositing platinum onto the membrane, which served as catalyst for the necessary hydrogen oxidation and oxygen reduction reactions. This became known as the 'Grubb-Niedrach fuel cell'. GE went on to develop this technology with NASA and McDonnell Aircraft, leading to its use during Project Gemini. This was the first commercial use of a fuel cell. It wasn't until 1959 that British engineer Francis Thomas Bacon successfully developed a 5 kW stationary fuel cell. In 1959, a team led by Harry Ihrig built a 15 kW fuel cell tractor for Allis-Chalmers which was demonstrated across the US at state fairs. This system used potassium hydroxide as the electrolyte and compressed hydrogen and oxygen as the reactants. Later in 1959, Bacon and his colleagues demonstrated a practical five-kilowatt unit capable of powering a welding machine. In the 1960s, Pratt and Whitney licensed Bacon's U.S. patents for use in the U.S. space program to supply electricity and drinking water (hydrogen and oxygen being readily available from the spacecraft tanks).</English>
		<French>[TAB]A fuel cell is an electrochemical energy conversion device. It produces electricity from various external quantities of fuel (on the anode side) and an oxidant (on the cathode side). These react in the presence of an electrolyte. Generally, the reactants flow in and reaction products flow out while the electrolyte remains in the cell. Fuel cells can operate virtually continuously as long as the necessary flows are maintained. [PARAGRAPH:2]Fuel cells are different from batteries in that they consume reactant, which must be replenished, whereas batteries store electrical energy chemically in a closed system. Additionally, while the electrodes within a battery react and change as a battery is charged or discharged, a fuel cell's electrodes are catalytic and relatively stable. Many combinations of fuel and oxidant are possible. A hydrogen cell uses hydrogen as fuel and oxygen as oxidant. Other fuels include hydrocarbons and alcohols. Other oxidants include air, chlorine and chlorine dioxide.[PARAGRAPH:2]The principle of the fuel cell was discovered by German scientist Christian Friedrich Sch&#246;nbein in 1838 and published in the January 1839 edition of the "Philosophical Magazine". Based on this work, the first fuel cell was developed by Welsh scientist Sir William Robert Grove in 1843. The fuel cell he made used similar materials to today's phosphoric-acid fuel cell. In 1955, W. Thomas Grubb, a chemist working for the General Electric Company (GE), further modified the original fuel cell design by using a sulphonated polystyrene ion-exchange membrane as the electrolyte. Three years later another GE chemist, Leonard Niedrach, devised a way of depositing platinum onto the membrane, which served as catalyst for the necessary hydrogen oxidation and oxygen reduction reactions. This became known as the 'Grubb-Niedrach fuel cell'. GE went on to develop this technology with NASA and McDonnell Aircraft, leading to its use during Project Gemini.

		<English>[TAB]Generally speaking, siege warfare is a form of constant, low intensity conflict characterized by one party holding a strong, static defensive position. Consequently, an opportunity for negotiation between combatants is not uncommon, as proximity and fluctuating advantage can encourage diplomacy. A siege occurs when an attacker encounters a city or fortress that cannot be easily taken by a coup de main and refuses to surrender. Sieges involve surrounding the target and blocking the reinforcement or escape of troops or provision of supplies typically coupled with attempts to reduce the fortifications by means of siege engines, artillery bombardment, mining (also known as sapping), or the use of deception or treachery to bypass defenses. Failing a military outcome, sieges can often be decided by starvation, thirst or disease, which can afflict either the attacker or defender. [PARAGRAPH:2]Sieges probably predate the development of cities as large population centers. Ancient cities in the Middle East show archaeological evidence of having had fortified city walls. During the Warring States era of ancient China, there is both textual and archaeological evidence of prolonged sieges and siege machinery used against the defenders of city walls. Siege machinery was also a tradition of the ancient Greco-Roman world. During the Renaissance and the Early Modern period, siege warfare dominated the conduct of war in Europe. Leonardo da Vinci gained as much of his renown from the design of fortifications as from his artwork. [PARAGRAPH:2]Medieval campaigns were generally designed around a succession of sieges. In the Napoleonic era, increasing use of ever more powerful cannon reduced the value of fortifications. In modern times, trenches replaced walls, and bunkers replaced castles. In the 20th century, the significance of the classical siege declined. With the advent of mobile warfare, a single fortified stronghold is no longer as decisive as it once was. While traditional sieges do still occur, they are not as common as they once were due to changes in modes of battle, principally the ease by which huge volumes of destructive power can be directed onto a static target. Modern sieges are more commonly the result of smaller hostage, militant, or extreme resisting-arrest situations such as the Waco Siege.</English>

		<Italian>[TAB]Generally speaking, siege warfare is a form of constant, low intensity conflict characterized by one party holding a strong, static defensive position. Consequently, an opportunity for negotiation between combatants is not uncommon, as proximity and fluctuating advantage can encourage diplomacy. A siege occurs when an attacker encounters a city or fortress that cannot be easily taken by a coup de main and refuses to surrender. Sieges involve surrounding the target and blocking the reinforcement or escape of troops or provision of supplies typically coupled with attempts to reduce the fortifications by means of siege engines, artillery bombardment, mining (also known as sapping), or the use of deception or treachery to bypass defenses. Failing a military outcome, sieges can often be decided by starvation, thirst or disease, which can afflict either the attacker or defender. [PARAGRAPH:2]Sieges probably predate the development of cities as large population centers. Ancient cities in the Middle East show archaeological evidence of having had fortified city walls. During the Warring States era of ancient China, there is both textual and archaeological evidence of prolonged sieges and siege machinery used against the defenders of city walls. Siege machinery was also a tradition of the ancient Greco-Roman world. During the Renaissance and the Early Modern period, siege warfare dominated the conduct of war in Europe. Leonardo da Vinci gained as much of his renown from the design of fortifications as from his artwork. [PARAGRAPH:2]Medieval campaigns were generally designed around a succession of sieges.

		<English>[TAB]Fermentation in food processing typically refers to the conversion of sugar to alcohol using yeast, bacteria, or a combination thereof, under anaerobic conditions. A more general definition of fermentation is the chemical conversion of carbohydrates into alcohols or acids.[PARAGRAPH:2]Human beings are known to have made fermented foods since Neolithic times. The earliest types were beer, wine, and leavened bread (made primarily by yeasts) and cheeses (made by bacteria and molds). These were soon followed by East Asian fermented foods, yogurt and other fermented milk products, pickles, sauerkraut, vinegar (soured wine), butter, and a host of traditional alcoholic beverages. More recently molds have been used in industrial fermentation to make vitamins B-2 (riboflavin) and B-12, textured protein products (from Fusarium and Rhizopus in Europe) antibiotics (such as penicillin), citric acid, and gluconic acid. Bacteria are now used to make the amino acids lysine and glutamic acid. Single-celled protein foods such as nutritional yeast and microalgae (spirulina, chlorella) are also made in modern industrial fermentations.[PARAGRAPH:2]For early societies, the transformation of basic food materials into fermented foods was a mystery and a miracle, for they had no idea what caused the usually sudden, dramatic, and welcomed transformation. Some societies attributed this to divine intervention; the Egyptians praised Osiris for the brewing of beer and the Greeks established Bacchus as the god of wine. Likewise, at many early Japanese miso and shoyu breweries, a small shrine occupied a central place and was bowed to daily.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Mounted archery was a defining characteristic of Steppe warfare throughout Central Asia, and throughout the prairies of America after the adoption of the horse, used by peoples including the Scythians, Sarmatians, Parthians, Huns, Bulgars, Magyars, Mongols, Turks, Comanches, and others. It was also adopted by other peoples and armies, notably Chinese and Romans who both suffered serious conflict with peoples practicing horse archery. It developed separately among the peoples of the South American pampas and the North American prairies; the Comanches were especially skilled. Horse archery was also particularly honoured in the samurai tradition of Japan, where mounted archery is called Yabusame. In some places, such as in Germany and Portugal, the crossbow was favoured over composite bow. Horse archery was never widely used south of the Sahara in Africa, where the ecosystem was less suitable for domestic horses. This was presumably due to factors such as the tsetse fly and lack of suitable fodder. Though some African kingdoms south of the Sahara used horses, they were less useful and had a high mortality rate in these regions. [PARAGRAPH:2]The natives of large grassland areas developed mounted archery for hunting, and for war. The buffalo hunts of the North American prairies may have been the most spectacular and best-recorded examples of bowhunting by mounted archers. Since using a bow requires a horseman to let go of the reins with both hands, horse archers need superb equestrian skills if they are to shoot on the move. It is thought that the Ancient Greeks invented the mythical Centaurs as the perfect union of an archer and a fast moving horseman. [PARAGRAPH:2]In battle, horsed archers were typically skirmishers; lightly-armed missile troops capable of moving swiftly to avoid close combat or to deliver a rapid blow to the flanks or rear of the foe. In the tactic of the Parthian shot the horseman would retreat from the enemy while turning his upper body and shooting backwards. Due to the superior speed of mounted archers, troops under attack from horse archers were unable to respond to the threat if they did not have ranged weapons of their own. Constant harassment would result in casualties, morale drop and disruption of the formation. Any attempts to charge the archers would also slow the entire army down.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Castes are systems of occupation, endogamy, social culture, social class, and political power, the assignment of individuals to places in the social hierarchy is determined by social group and cultural heritage. Although India is often now associated with the word "caste", it was first used by the Portuguese to describe inherited class status in their own European society.[PARAGRAPH:2]In medieval Europe, the estates of the realm were a caste system. The population was divided into nobility, clergy, and the commoners. In some regions, the commoners were divided into burghers, peasants or serfs, and the estateless. Although originally based on occupation, one's estate was eventually inherited, because of low social mobility.  Poland's nobility were more numerous than those of all other European countries, forming some 8% of the total population in 1791, and almost 16% among ethnic Poles. By contrast, the nobilities of other European countries, except for Spain and Hungary, amounted to a mere 1-3%.  In France, serfdom lasted legally until 1789. It persisted in Austria-Hungary till 1848 and was abolished in Russia only in 1861.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Indian caste system describes the social stratification and social restrictions in the Indian subcontinent, in which social classes are defined by thousands of endogamous hereditary groups, often termed as j&#257;tis or castes. Within a j&#257;ti, there exist exogamous groups known as gotras, the lineage or clan of an individual, although in a handful of sub-castes like Shakadvipi, endogamy within a gotra is permitted and alternative mechanisms of restricting endogamy are used (e.g. banning endogamy within a surname).  The fluidity of the caste system was affected by the arrival of the British. Prior to that, the relative ranking of castes differed from one place to another.  The castes did not constitute a rigid description of the occupation or the social status of a group. Since the British society was divided by class, the British attempted to equate the Indian caste system to the class system. They saw caste as an indicator of occupation, social standing, and intellectual ability.  During the initial days of the British East India Company's rule, caste privileges and customs were encouraged,  but the British law courts disagreed with the discrimination against the lower castes. However, British policies of divide and rule as well as enumeration of the population into rigid categories during the 10 year census contributed towards the hardening of caste identities.</English>

Although India is often now associated with the word "caste", it was first used by the Portuguese to describe inherited class status in their own European society.[PARAGRAPH:2]In medieval Europe, the estates of the realm were a caste system. The population was divided into nobility, clergy, and the commoners. In some regions, the commoners were divided into burghers, peasants or serfs, and the estateless. Although originally based on occupation, one's estate was eventually inherited, because of low social mobility.  Poland's nobility were more numerous than those of all other European countries, forming some 8% of the total population in 1791, and almost 16% among ethnic Poles. By contrast, the nobilities of other European countries, except for Spain and Hungary, amounted to a mere 1-3%.  In France, serfdom lasted legally until 1789. It persisted in Austria-Hungary till 1848 and was abolished in Russia only in 1861.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Indian caste system describes the social stratification and social restrictions in the Indian subcontinent, in which social classes are defined by thousands of endogamous hereditary groups, often termed as j&#257;tis or castes. Within a j&#257;ti, there exist exogamous groups known as gotras, the lineage or clan of an individual, although in a handful of sub-castes like Shakadvipi, endogamy within a gotra is permitted and alternative mechanisms of restricting endogamy are used (e.g. banning endogamy within a surname).  The fluidity of the caste system was affected by the arrival of the British. Prior to that, the relative ranking of castes differed from one place to another.  The castes did not constitute a rigid description of the occupation or the social status of a group. Since the British society was divided by class, the British attempted to equate the Indian caste system to the class system. They saw caste as an indicator of occupation, social standing, and intellectual ability.  During the initial days of the British East India Company's rule, caste privileges and customs were encouraged,  but the British law courts disagreed with the discrimination against the lower castes.

From the ancient Greeks, the term passed on to the European Middle Ages for a similar hereditary class of military leaders often referred to as the "nobility".

However looking at results of post graduate exams, medical schools (specifically Birmingham) that use prosection as opposed to dissection do very well in these examinations. This would suggest that prosection can fit very well into the structure of modern medical training.</Italian>
		<Spanish>[TAB]The history of anatomy as a science extends from the earliest examinations of sacrificial victims to the sophisticated analyses of the body performed by modern scientists. It has been characterized, over time, by a continually developing understanding of the functions of organs and structures in the body. The field of Human Anatomy has a prestigious history, and is considered to be the most prominent of the biological sciences of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Methods have also improved dramatically, advancing from examination of animals through dissection of cadavers to technologically complex techniques developed in the 20th century.[PARAGRAPH:2]Anatomy teaching is one of the cornerstones of a doctor&#8217;s medical education. Despite being a persistent portion of teaching from at least the renaissance, the format and the amount of information being taught has evolved and changed along with the demands of the profession. What is being taught today may differ in content significantly from the past but the methods used to teach this have not really changed that much. For example all the famous public dissections of the middle ages and early renaissance were in fact prosections. Prosection is the direction in which many current medical schools are heading in order to aid the teaching of anatomy and some argue that dissection is better. However looking at results of post graduate exams, medical schools (specifically Birmingham) that use prosection as opposed to dissection do very well in these examinations.

		<English>[TAB]Algebra is a major branch of mathematics concerning the study of the rules of operations (i.e. addition and multiplication) on sets of numbers that are often represented by symbols, called variables. Algebra can be divided into several major classifications, including elementary algebra, linear algebra, modern algebra, and algebraic geometry.  Elementary algebra is the most fundamental and common form of algebra and can be taught to students who have little knowledge of mathematics beyond basic arithmetic.  The more advanced forms of algebra can be used to solve enormously complex and varied equations involving algebraic concepts such as polynomials, matrices, vector space, and rings.   Algebra is essential to the theory of mathematical analysis and differential equations. Its applications extend beyond the physical sciences into, for example, biology and economics.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The technology to produce plate steel had been in place for many centuries: coats of plates, or brigandine, had been used for at least fifty years prior to the fourteenth century. These consisted of plates that were riveted to a cloth surface.  In this image, several examples can be seen, but they are not immediately obvious: from the outside, they look like thick padded cloth or leather with rows of studs embedded in them ("Studded leather" as an armor is an ahistorical term that comes from not correctly recognizing brigandine). Brigandine protects from cuts, and is much better at shirking off impacts than is mail. However, brigandine does not quite give its wearer the freedom of movement that mail does, and it's not practical for armoring the limbs: often a brigandine "shirt" must be worn with either mail or with plates for the arms or legs.[PARAGRAPH:2]With the advent of larger forces of footmen armed with pole weapons, however, such protection was not always adequate. In addition, archery remained a problem with the widespread use of the crossbow among the Italian city-states. Since the links inevitably had holes, the heads of crossbow quarrels, and even the arrowheads of particularly powerful bows (such as the English longbow and the stronger composite bows such as used by some Hungarian troops and especially those used by Ottoman archers) could penetrate directly through a fighter's armor. Padding helped, but generally not enough. Therefore, during the course of the fourteenth century, plate steel was added to those places most likely to be hit by missile fire, and gradually complete suits of plate armor were created. This suit of transitional mail is an excellent example: the breastplate and backplate provide protection from missile fire, with the next areas armored being the forearms, which are very vulnerable on the battlefield. These suits had an additional advantage: while mail and brigandine provide excellent protection at a relatively slight cost to mobility, the wearer of a suit of full plate armor is essentially immune to cutting attacks from single-handed swords. Crossbow power and plate armor hardness each steadily increased, as armorers provided better protection, and crossbow makers increased the power of their weapons so that they would still be effective.</English>

Blacksmiths produce things like wrought iron gates, grills, railings, light fixtures, furniture, sculpture, tools, agricultural implements, decorative and religious items, cooking utensils, horse shoes and weapons.  Blacksmiths work with "black" metals, typically iron. The black color comes from fire scale, a layer of oxides that forms on the surface of the metal during heating. The term 'smith' originates from the word 'smite', which means 'to hit'. Thus, a blacksmith is a person who smites black metal.

		<English>[TAB]Traditionally, the term neural network had been used to refer to a network or circuit of biological neurons. The modern usage of the term often refers to artificial neural networks, which are composed of artificial neurons or nodes. Thus the term has two distinct usages: [PARAGRAPH:2]1. Biological neural networks are made up of real biological neurons that are connected or functionally related in the peripheral nervous system or the central nervous system. In the field of neuroscience, they are often identified as groups of neurons that perform a specific physiological function in laboratory analysis. [PARAGRAPH:2]2. Artificial neural networks are made up of interconnecting artificial neurons (programming constructs that mimic the properties of biological neurons). Artificial neural networks may either be used to gain an understanding of biological neural networks, or for solving artificial intelligence problems without necessarily creating a model of a real biological system. The real, biological nervous system is highly complex and includes some features that may seem superfluous based on an understanding of artificial networks. [PARAGRAPH:2]In general a biological neural network is composed of a group or groups of chemically connected or functionally associated neurons. A single neuron may be connected to many other neurons and the total number of neurons and connections in a network may be extensive. Connections, called synapses, are usually formed from axons to dendrites, though dendrodendritic microcircuits and other connections are possible. Apart from the electrical signaling, there are other forms of signaling that arise from neurotransmitter diffusion, which have an effect on electrical signaling. As such, neural networks are extremely complex.[PARAGRAPH:2]Artificial intelligence and cognitive modeling try to simulate some properties of neural networks.

		<French>[TAB]Traditionally, the term neural network had been used to refer to a network or circuit of biological neurons. The modern usage of the term often refers to artificial neural networks, which are composed of artificial neurons or nodes. Thus the term has two distinct usages: [PARAGRAPH:2]1. Biological neural networks are made up of real biological neurons that are connected or functionally related in the peripheral nervous system or the central nervous system. In the field of neuroscience, they are often identified as groups of neurons that perform a specific physiological function in laboratory analysis. [PARAGRAPH:2]2. Artificial neural networks are made up of interconnecting artificial neurons (programming constructs that mimic the properties of biological neurons). Artificial neural networks may either be used to gain an understanding of biological neural networks, or for solving artificial intelligence problems without necessarily creating a model of a real biological system. The real, biological nervous system is highly complex and includes some features that may seem superfluous based on an understanding of artificial networks. [PARAGRAPH:2]In general a biological neural network is composed of a group or groups of chemically connected or functionally associated neurons. A single neuron may be connected to many other neurons and the total number of neurons and connections in a network may be extensive. Connections, called synapses, are usually formed from axons to dendrites, though dendrodendritic microcircuits and other connections are possible. Apart from the electrical signaling, there are other forms of signaling that arise from neurotransmitter diffusion, which have an effect on electrical signaling. As such, neural networks are extremely complex.[PARAGRAPH:2]Artificial intelligence and cognitive modeling try to simulate some properties of neural networks.

		<English>[TAB]At the end of the 1990s, MirCorp, a private venture by then in charge of the space station, began seeking potential space tourists to visit Mir in order to offset some of its maintenance costs. Dennis Tito, an American businessman and former JPL scientist, became their first candidate. When the decision to de-orbit Mir was made, Tito managed to switch his trip to the International Space Station through a deal between MirCorp and U.S.-based Space Adventures, Ltd., despite strong opposition from senior figures at NASA. Space Adventures remains the only company to have sent paying passengers to space.[PARAGRAPH:2]In conjunction with the Federal Space Agency of the Russian Federation and Rocket and Space Corporation Energia, Space Adventures facilitated the flights for the world's first private space explorers: Dennis Tito, Mark Shuttleworth, Gregory Olsen, Anousheh Ansari and Charles Simonyi. The first three participants paid in excess of $20 million (USD) each for their 10-day visit to the ISS.[PARAGRAPH:2]On April 28, 2001, Dennis Tito became the first "fee-paying" space tourist when he visited the International Space Station (ISS) for seven days. He was followed in 2002 by South African computer millionaire Mark Shuttleworth. The third was Gregory Olsen in 2005, who was trained as a scientist and whose company produced specialist high-sensitivity cameras. Olsen planned to use his time on the ISS to conduct a number of experiments, in part to test his company's products. Olsen had planned an earlier flight, but had to cancel for health reasons.[PARAGRAPH:2]After the Columbia disaster, space tourism on the Russian Soyuz program was temporarily put on hold, because Soyuz vehicles became the only available transport to the ISS. However, in 2006, space tourism was resumed. On September 18, 2006, Anousheh Ansari, an Iranian American (Soyuz TMA-9), became the fourth space tourist (she prefers spaceflight participant). On April 7, 2007, Charles Simonyi, an American billionaire of Hungarian descent, joined their ranks (Soyuz TMA-10).[PARAGRAPH:2]In 2003, NASA and the Russian Space Agency agreed to use the term 'Spaceflight Participant' to distinguish those space travelers from astronauts on missions coordinated by those two agencies. Tito, Shuttleworth, Olsen, Ansari, and Simonyi were designated as such during their respective space flights. NASA also lists Christa McAuliffe as a "Space Flight Participant" (although she did not pay a fee), apparently due to her non-technical duties aboard the STS-51-L flight. [PARAGRAPH:2]Several plans have been proposed for using a space station as a hotel. American motel tycoon Robert Bigelow has acquired the designs for inflatable space habitats from the Transhab program abandoned by NASA. His company, Bigelow Aerospace already launched the first inflatable habitat module named Genesis I in 12 July 2006. The second test module, Genesis II was launched 28 June 2007. It is also currently planning to launch a prototype space station module by late 2008, and plans to officially launch the first commercial space station by 2012 (tagged Nautilus) which will have 330 cubic meters (almost as big as the ISS's 425 cubic meters of usable volume). Bigelow Aerospace is currently offering the America's Space Prize, a $50 million prize to the first US company to create a reusable spacecraft capable of carrying passengers to a Nautilus space station. [PARAGRAPH:2]Other companies have also expressed interest in constructing "space hotels". For example, Excalibur Almaz plans to modernize and launch its Soviet-era Almaz space stations, which will feature the largest windows ever on spacecraft. Virgin's Richard Branson has expressed his hope for the construction of a space hotel within his lifetime. He expects that beginning a space tourism program will cost $100 million. Hilton International announced the Space Islands Project, a plan to connect together used space shuttle fuel tanks, each the diameter of a Boeing 747 aircraft. A separate organization, Space Island Group announced their distinct Space Island Project (note the singular "Island"), and plans on having 20,000 people on their "space island" by 2020, with the number of people doubling for each decade. British Airways has expressed interest in the venture. If and when Space Hotels develop, it would initially cost a passenger $60,000, with prices lowering over time.</English>

		<Italian>[TAB]At the end of the 1990s, MirCorp, a private venture by then in charge of the space station, began seeking potential space tourists to visit Mir in order to offset some of its maintenance costs. Dennis Tito, an American businessman and former JPL scientist, became their first candidate. When the decision to de-orbit Mir was made, Tito managed to switch his trip to the International Space Station through a deal between MirCorp and U.S.-based Space Adventures, Ltd., despite strong opposition from senior figures at NASA. Space Adventures remains the only company to have sent paying passengers to space.[PARAGRAPH:2]In conjunction with the Federal Space Agency of the Russian Federation and Rocket and Space Corporation Energia, Space Adventures facilitated the flights for the world's first private space explorers: Dennis Tito, Mark Shuttleworth, Gregory Olsen, Anousheh Ansari and Charles Simonyi. The first three participants paid in excess of $20 million (USD) each for their 10-day visit to the ISS.[PARAGRAPH:2]On April 28, 2001, Dennis Tito became the first "fee-paying" space tourist when he visited the International Space Station (ISS) for seven days. He was followed in 2002 by South African computer millionaire Mark Shuttleworth. The third was Gregory Olsen in 2005, who was trained as a scientist and whose company produced specialist high-sensitivity cameras. Olsen planned to use his time on the ISS to conduct a number of experiments, in part to test his company's products. Olsen had planned an earlier flight, but had to cancel for health reasons.[PARAGRAPH:2]After the Columbia disaster, space tourism on the Russian Soyuz program was temporarily put on hold, because Soyuz vehicles became the only available transport to the ISS. However, in 2006, space tourism was resumed. On September 18, 2006, Anousheh Ansari, an Iranian American (Soyuz TMA-9), became the fourth space tourist (she prefers spaceflight participant). On April 7, 2007, Charles Simonyi, an American billionaire of Hungarian descent, joined their ranks (Soyuz TMA-10).[PARAGRAPH:2]In 2003, NASA and the Russian Space Agency agreed to use the term 'Spaceflight Participant' to distinguish those space travelers from astronauts on missions coordinated by those two agencies. Tito, Shuttleworth, Olsen, Ansari, and Simonyi were designated as such during their respective space flights. NASA also lists Christa McAuliffe as a "Space Flight Participant" (although she did not pay a fee), apparently due to her non-technical duties aboard the STS-51-L flight. [PARAGRAPH:2]Several plans have been proposed for using a space station as a hotel. American motel tycoon Robert Bigelow has acquired the designs for inflatable space habitats from the Transhab program abandoned by NASA. His company, Bigelow Aerospace already launched the first inflatable habitat module named Genesis I in 12 July 2006. The second test module, Genesis II was launched 28 June 2007. It is also currently planning to launch a prototype space station module by late 2008, and plans to officially launch the first commercial space station by 2012 (tagged Nautilus) which will have 330 cubic meters (almost as big as the ISS's 425 cubic meters of usable volume). Bigelow Aerospace is currently offering the America's Space Prize, a $50 million prize to the first US company to create a reusable spacecraft capable of carrying passengers to a Nautilus space station. [PARAGRAPH:2]Other companies have also expressed interest in constructing "space hotels". For example, Excalibur Almaz plans to modernize and launch its Soviet-era Almaz space stations, which will feature the largest windows ever on spacecraft. Virgin's Richard Branson has expressed his hope for the construction of a space hotel within his lifetime. He expects that beginning a space tourism program will cost $100 million. Hilton International announced the Space Islands Project, a plan to connect together used space shuttle fuel tanks, each the diameter of a Boeing 747 aircraft. A separate organization, Space Island Group announced their distinct Space Island Project (note the singular "Island"), and plans on having 20,000 people on their "space island" by 2020, with the number of people doubling for each decade.

		<English>[TAB]In physics and chemistry, plasma is a partially ionized gas, in which a certain proportion of electrons are free rather than being bound to an atom or molecule. The ability of the positive and negative charges to move somewhat independently makes the plasma electrically conductive so that it responds strongly to electromagnetic fields. Plasma therefore has properties quite unlike those of solids, liquids or gases and is considered to be a distinct state of matter. Plasma typically takes the form of neutral gas-like clouds, as seen, for example, in the case of stars. Like gas, plasma does not have a definite shape or a definite volume unless enclosed in a container, but unlike gas, in the influence of a magnetic field, it may form structures such as filaments, beams and double layers. [PARAGRAPH:2]For plasma to exist, ionization is necessary. The term "plasma density" by itself usually refers to the "electron density", that is, the number of free electrons per unit volume. The degree of ionization of a plasma is the proportion of atoms which have lost (or gained) electrons, and is controlled mostly by the temperature. Even a partially ionized gas in which as little as 1% of the particles are ionized can have the characteristics of a plasma (i.e. respond to magnetic fields and are highly electrically conductive).[PARAGRAPH:2]Temperature controls the degree of plasma ionization. In particular, plasma ionization is determined by the "electron temperature" relative to the ionization energy (and more weakly by the density) in a relationship called the Saha equation. A plasma is sometimes referred to as being "hot" if it is nearly fully ionized, or "cold" if only a small fraction (for example 1%) of the gas molecules are ionized (but other definitions of the terms "hot plasma" and "cold plasma" are common). Even in a "cold" plasma the electron temperature is still typically several thousand degrees Celsius. Plasmas utilized in "plasma technology" ("technological plasmas") are usually cold in this sense.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Cognitive robotics is concerned with endowing robots with mammalian and human-like cognitive capabilities to enable the achievement of complex goals in complex environments. Cognitive robotics is focused on using animal cognition as a starting point for the development of robotic computational algorithms, as opposed to more traditional Artificial Intelligence techniques, which may or may not draw upon mammalian and human cognition as an inspiration for algorithm development. Robotic cognitive capabilities include perception processing, attention allocation, anticipation, planning, reasoning about other agents, and perhaps reasoning about their own mental states. Robotic cognition embodies the behaviour of intelligent agents in the physical world (or a virtual world, in the case of simulated CR). In the most ambitious version, this implies that the robot must also be able to act in this real world.[PARAGRAPH:2]Cognitive robotics involves the application and integration of various artificial intelligence disciplines but is primarily inspired by psychology and brain science research. On the other hand, the robot capabilities will be limited by the current state of the art in robotics: the mechanics and electronics of robots are still very inferior to what humans have available, especially in the areas of tactile and visual sensing, the smoothness and energy efficiency of motion (including walking and object manipulation with fingers), and the task-directed planning of actions.[PARAGRAPH:2]One of the learning techniques that are used for robots is learning by imitation: the robot, provided with all the sensors and physical hardware needed to perform a human task, is monitoring the human performing a task, and then the robot tries to imitate the same movements that the human performed in order to achieve the task. Using its sensors, the robot should be able to create a three-dimensional image of the environment, and to recognize the objects in that image. A major challenge is hence to interpret the scene, and to understand what objects are needed in the task and which are not.[PARAGRAPH:2]A more complex learning approach is autonomous knowledge acquisition: the robot now uses its sensors and its knowledge about the physical properties of the world, and is then left to explore the environment on its own. One of the terminologies of this behaviour is called motor babbling. Basically the whole idea of this approach is to let the robot discover its capabilities on its own.</English>

On the other hand, the robot capabilities will be limited by the current state of the art in robotics: the mechanics and electronics of robots are still very inferior to what humans have available, especially in the areas of tactile and visual sensing, the smoothness and energy efficiency of motion (including walking and object manipulation with fingers), and the task-directed planning of actions.[PARAGRAPH:2]One of the learning techniques that are used for robots is learning by imitation: the robot, provided with all the sensors and physical hardware needed to perform a human task, is monitoring the human performing a task, and then the robot tries to imitate the same movements that the human performed in order to achieve the task. Using its sensors, the robot should be able to create a three-dimensional image of the environment, and to recognize the objects in that image. A major challenge is hence to interpret the scene, and to understand what objects are needed in the task and which are not.[PARAGRAPH:2]A more complex learning approach is autonomous knowledge acquisition: the robot now uses its sensors and its knowledge about the physical properties of the world, and is then left to explore the environment on its own. One of the terminologies of this behaviour is called motor babbling. Basically the whole idea of this approach is to let the robot discover its capabilities on its own.</Spanish>

		<English>[TAB]Rapid prototyping is the automatic construction of physical objects using solid freeform fabrication. The first techniques for rapid prototyping became available in the late 1980s and were used to produce models and prototype parts. Today, they are used for a much wider range of applications and are even used to manufacture production quality parts in relatively small numbers. Some sculptors use the technology to produce complex shapes for fine arts exhibitions.[PARAGRAPH:2]Rapid prototyping takes virtual designs from computer aided design (CAD) or animation modeling software, transforms them into thin, virtual, horizontal cross-sections and then creates each cross-section in physical space, one after the next until the model is finished. It is a WYSIWYG process where the virtual model and the physical model correspond almost identically.[PARAGRAPH:2]With additive fabrication, the machine reads in data from a CAD drawing and lays down successive layers of liquid, powder, or sheet material, and in this way builds up the model from a series of cross sections. These layers, which correspond to the virtual cross section from the CAD model, are joined together or fused automatically to create the final shape. The primary advantage to additive fabrication is its ability to create almost any shape or geometric feature.[PARAGRAPH:2]The standard data interface between CAD software and the machines is the STL file format. An STL file approximates the shape of a part or assembly using triangular facets. Smaller facets produce a higher quality surface.[PARAGRAPH:2]The word "rapid" is relative: construction of a model with contemporary methods can take from several hours to several days, depending on the method used and the size and complexity of the model. Additive systems for rapid prototyping can typically produce models in a few hours, although it can vary widely depending on the type of machine being used and the size and number of models being produced simultaneously.[PARAGRAPH:2]Some solid freeform fabrication techniques use two materials in the course of constructing parts. The first material is the part material and the second is the support material (to support overhanging features during construction). The support material is later removed by heat or dissolved away with a solvent or water.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Quantum teleportation, or entanglement-assisted teleportation, is a technique used to transfer information on a quantum level, usually from one particle (or series of particles) to another particle (or series of particles) in another location via quantum entanglement. It does not transport energy or matter, nor does it allow communication of information at superluminal (faster than light) speed. Neither does it concern rearranging the particles of a macroscopic object to copy the form of another object. Therefore it is quite distinct from the teleportation common in science fiction in which a macroscopic object is recreated at another location. Its distinguishing feature is that it can transmit the information present in a quantum superposition, useful for quantum communication and computation. [PARAGRAPH:2]More precisely, quantum teleportation is a quantum protocol by which a qubit a (the basic unit of quantum information) can be transmitted exactly (in principle) from one location to another. The prerequisites are a conventional communication channel capable of transmitting two classical bits (i.e. one of four states), and an entangled pair (b,c) of qubits, with b at the origin and c at the destination. (So whereas b and c are intimately related, a is entirely independent of them other than being initially colocated with b.) The protocol has three steps: measure a and b jointly to yield two classical bits; transmit the two bits to the other end of the channel (the only potentially time-consuming step, due to speed-of-light considerations); and use the two bits to select one of four ways of recovering c. The upshot of this protocol is to permute the original arrangement ((a,b),c) to ((b&#8242;,c&#8242;),a), that is, a moves to where c was and the previously separated qubits of the Bell pair turn into a new Bell pair (b&#8242;,c&#8242;) at the origin.</English>

		<English>[TAB]A metamaterial (or meta material) is a material which gains its properties from its structure rather than directly from its composition. To distinguish metamaterials from other composite materials, the metamaterial label is usually used for a material which has unusual properties. The term was coined in 1999 by Rodger M. Walser of the University of Texas at Austin. He defined metamaterials as: Macroscopic composites having a manmade, three-dimensional, periodic cellular architecture designed to produce an optimized combination, not available in nature, of two or more responses to specific excitation.[PARAGRAPH:2]Electromagnetics researchers often use the term quite narrowly for materials which exhibit negative refraction W.E. Kock developed the first metamaterials in the late 1940s with metal-lens antennae and metallic delay lenses.[PARAGRAPH:2]Metamaterials are of particular importance in electromagnetism (especially optics and photonics). They show promise for optical and microwave applications such as new types of beam steerers, modulators, band-pass filters, lenses, microwave couplers, and antenna radomes.[PARAGRAPH:2]A metamaterial affects electromagnetic waves by having structural features smaller than the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation it interacts with. For instance, if a metamaterial is to behave as a homogeneous material accurately described by an effective refractive index, its features must be much smaller than the wavelength. For visible light, whose wavelength is less than one micrometre typically (560 nanometres for sunlight), the structures are generally half this size or smaller; i.e., less than 280 nanometres. For microwave radiation, the structures need only be on the order of one decimetre. Microwave frequency metamaterials are usually manmade, constructed as arrays of electrically conductive elements (such as loops of wire) which have suitable inductive and capacitive characteristics.[PARAGRAPH:2]Metamaterials usually consist of periodic structures, and thus have many similarities with photonic crystals and frequency selective surfaces. However, these are usually considered distinct from metamaterials, as their features are of similar size to the wavelength at which they function, and thus cannot be approximated as a homogeneous material.[PARAGRAPH:2]Metamaterials may be a possible basis for building a cloaking device. Such a device typically involves surrounding the object to be cloaked with a shell which affects the passage of light near it. On 14 February 2005, Andrea Alu and Nader Engheta at the University of Pennsylvania issued a research paper which claimed that plasmons could be used to cancel out visible light or radiation coming from an object. This 'plasmonic cover' would work by suppressing light scattering by resonating with illuminated light, which could render objects "nearly invisible to an observer." The plasmonic screen would have to be tuned to the object being hidden, and would only suppress a specific wavelength - an object made invisible in red light would still be visible in multiwavelength daylight.[PARAGRAPH:2]Metamaterials have been proposed for designing agile antennae. Research at the National Institute of Standards and Technology has demonstrated that thin metamaterial films can greatly reduce the size of resonating circuits that generate microwaves, potentially enabling even smaller cell phones and other microwave devices. It has been theorized that metamaterials could be built to bend matter around them because of the subatomic properties of matter. Such a matter cloak could for example bend a bullet around a person rather than absorb the impact as traditional bulletproof vests do.</English>

To distinguish metamaterials from other composite materials, the metamaterial label is usually used for a material which has unusual properties. The term was coined in 1999 by Rodger M. Walser of the University of Texas at Austin. He defined metamaterials as: Macroscopic composites having a manmade, three-dimensional, periodic cellular architecture designed to produce an optimized combination, not available in nature, of two or more responses to specific excitation.[PARAGRAPH:2]Electromagnetics researchers often use the term quite narrowly for materials which exhibit negative refraction W.E. Kock developed the first metamaterials in the late 1940s with metal-lens antennae and metallic delay lenses.[PARAGRAPH:2]Metamaterials are of particular importance in electromagnetism (especially optics and photonics). They show promise for optical and microwave applications such as new types of beam steerers, modulators, band-pass filters, lenses, microwave couplers, and antenna radomes.[PARAGRAPH:2]A metamaterial affects electromagnetic waves by having structural features smaller than the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation it interacts with. For instance, if a metamaterial is to behave as a homogeneous material accurately described by an effective refractive index, its features must be much smaller than the wavelength. For visible light, whose wavelength is less than one micrometre typically (560 nanometres for sunlight), the structures are generally half this size or smaller; i.e., less than 280 nanometres. For microwave radiation, the structures need only be on the order of one decimetre. Microwave frequency metamaterials are usually manmade, constructed as arrays of electrically conductive elements (such as loops of wire) which have suitable inductive and capacitive characteristics.[PARAGRAPH:2]Metamaterials usually consist of periodic structures, and thus have many similarities with photonic crystals and frequency selective surfaces. However, these are usually considered distinct from metamaterials, as their features are of similar size to the wavelength at which they function, and thus cannot be approximated as a homogeneous material.[PARAGRAPH:2]Metamaterials may be a possible basis for building a cloaking device. Such a device typically involves surrounding the object to be cloaked with a shell which affects the passage of light near it. On 14 February 2005, Andrea Alu and Nader Engheta at the University of Pennsylvania issued a research paper which claimed that plasmons could be used to cancel out visible light or radiation coming from an object. This 'plasmonic cover' would work by suppressing light scattering by resonating with illuminated light, which could render objects "nearly invisible to an observer." The plasmonic screen would have to be tuned to the object being hidden, and would only suppress a specific wavelength - an object made invisible in red light would still be visible in multiwavelength daylight.[PARAGRAPH:2]Metamaterials have been proposed for designing agile antennae. Research at the National Institute of Standards and Technology has demonstrated that thin metamaterial films can greatly reduce the size of resonating circuits that generate microwaves, potentially enabling even smaller cell phones and other microwave devices. It has been theorized that metamaterials could be built to bend matter around them because of the subatomic properties of matter. Such a matter cloak could for example bend a bullet around a person rather than absorb the impact as traditional bulletproof vests do.</Spanish>

		<English>[TAB]A railgun is a purely electrical gun that accelerates a conductive projectile along a pair of metal rails using the same principles as the homopolar motor. Railguns use two sliding or rolling contacts that permit a large electric current to pass through the projectile. This current interacts with the strong magnetic fields generated by the rails and this accelerates the projectile. The U.S. Navy has tested a railgun that accelerates a 7 pound projectile to seven times the speed of sound. [PARAGRAPH:2]Railguns are being pursued as weapons with projectiles that do not contain explosives, but are given extremely high velocities: 3500 m/s (11,500 ft/s, approximately Mach 10 at sea level) or more (for comparison, the M16 rifle has a muzzle speed of 930 m/s, or 3,000 ft/s), which would make their kinetic energy equal or superior to the energy yield of an explosive-filled shell of greater mass. This would allow more ammunition to be carried and eliminate the hazards of carrying explosives in a tank or naval weapons platform. Also, by firing at higher velocities railguns have greater range, less bullet drop and less wind drift, bypassing the inherent cost and physical limitations of conventional firearms - "the limits of gas expansion prohibit launching an unassisted projectile to velocities greater than about 1.5 km/s and ranges of more than 50 miles [80 km] from a practical conventional gun system."[PARAGRAPH:2]If it were possible to apply the technology as a rapid-fire automatic weapon, a railgun would have further advantages in increased rate of fire. The feed mechanisms of a conventional firearm must move to accommodate the propellant charge as well as the ammunition round, while a railgun would only need to accommodate the projectile. Furthermore, a railgun would not have to extract a spent cartridge case from the breech, meaning that a fresh round could be cycled almost immediately after the previous round has been shot.</English>

Such tests may be expensive and may involve a large number of permutations (e.g., in the case of composites, constituent material combinations, fiber/particle volume fractions, fiber/particle arrangements, and processing histories). Furthermore, continuum micromechanics can predict the full multi-axial properties and response of inhomogeneous materials, which often are anisotropic. Such properties are often difficult to measure experimentally, but they are required, e.g., for structural analysis involving composites. Of course, to rely on micromechanics, the particular micromechanics theory must be validated through comparison to experimental data. [PARAGRAPH:2]The second main task of continuum micromechanics is localization, which aims at evaluating the local (stress and strain) fields in the phases for given macroscopic load states, phase properties and phase geometries.

While one uses a type of fishnet of metal layers to reverse the direction of light, the other uses tiny silver wires. Xiang Zhang, of the University of California, Berkeley said: "In the case of invisibility cloaks or shields, the material would need to curve light waves completely around the object like a river flowing around a rock.

While one uses a type of fishnet of metal layers to reverse the direction of light, the other uses tiny silver wires. Xiang Zhang, of the University of California, Berkeley said: "In the case of invisibility cloaks or shields, the material would need to curve light waves completely around the object like a river flowing around a rock.

Valentine's team created their 'fishnet' material by stacking silver and metal dielectric layers on top of each other and then punched through with holes. The other team used an oxide template and grew silver nanowires inside porous aluminum oxide at tiny distances apart, smaller than the wavelength of visible light.

		<Spanish>[TAB]Invisibility is the state of an object which cannot be seen. An object in this state is said to be Invisible (literally, "not visible").

		<English>[TAB]Vertical farming is a proposal to conduct large-scale agriculture in urban high-rises or "farmscrapers". Using recycled resources and greenhouse methods such as hydroponics, these buildings would produce fruit, vegetables, edible mushrooms and algae year-round. Their proponents argue that, by allowing traditional outdoor farms to revert to a natural state and reducing the energy costs needed to transport foods to consumers, vertical farms could significantly alleviate climate change produced by excess atmospheric carbon. [PARAGRAPH:2]Dickson Despommier, a professor of environmental health sciences and microbiology at Columbia University in New York City, developed the idea of vertical farming in 1999 with graduate students in a medical ecology class. Architectural designs have been produced by Andrew Kranis at Columbia University and Gordon Graff at the University of Waterloo.[PARAGRAPH:2]Several potential advantages of vertical farming have been discussed by Despommier. Many of these benefits are obtained from scaling up hydroponic or aeroponic growing methods. Others relate to vertical farming building designs that would allow the use of renewable energy sources (wind and solar) and the recycling of materials of production such as water.[PARAGRAPH:2]Unlike traditional farming, indoor farming can produce crops year-round. All-season farming multiplies the productivity of the farmed surface by a factor of 4 to 6 depending on the crop. With some crops, such as strawberries, the factor may be as high as 30.[PARAGRAPH:2]Because it provides a controlled environment, the productivity of vertical farms would be independent of weather and protected from extreme weather events. Protection from extreme weather may become a crucial feature as climate change increases the occurrence of such events.[PARAGRAPH:2]The widespread adoption of vertical farming would allow much existing farmland to be returned to nature. This could reduce deforestation, desertification, and other consequences of agricultural encroachment on natural biomes.[PARAGRAPH:2]Because vertical farming allows crops to be grown closer to consumers, it may substantially reduce the amount of fossil fuels currently used to transport and refrigerate farm produce. Producing food indoors reduces or eliminates conventional plowing, planting, and harvesting by farm machinery powered by fossil fuels. Burning less fossil fuel would reduce air pollution and the carbon dioxide emissions that cause climate change.[PARAGRAPH:2]The controlled growing environment and recycling reduces the need for pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers. Advocates claim that producing organic crops in vertical farms is practical and the most likely production and marketing strategy.[PARAGRAPH:2]Because water recycling is more practical and economic in a controlled agricultural environment, vertical farming would use much less water than traditional farming. Vertical farming would convert black and gray water into potable water by collecting the water released into the air by evapotranspiration. Today, over 70% of the liquid fresh water on Earth is used for conventional agriculture. The agriculture often pollutes the water with fertilizers and pesticides. Vertical farms will use less water, and recycle it. The recycling condenses water transpired from the plants. This recycled water is pure, and can be used for crops or drinking.[PARAGRAPH:2]Vertical farms are potential locations for power generation. Methane digesters could be built on site to transform the organic waste generated at the farm into Biogas which is generally composed of 65% methane along with a host of other gasses. This Biogas can then be burned to generate electricity that can either be consumed at the farm or added to the grid.[PARAGRAPH:2]Because vertical farming would be conducted in a controlled indoor environment, there is opportunity to reduce the incidence of many infectious diseases that are acquired at the agricultural interface.[PARAGRAPH:2]Vertical Farming, used in conjunction with other technologies and socioeconomic practices, could allow cities to expand while remaining largely self sufficient. This would allow for large urban centers that could grow without destroying considerably larger areas of forest to provide food for their people.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Mind uploading, whole brain emulation or mind transfer refers to the hypothetical process of scanning and mapping a biological brain in detail and copying its state into a computer system or another computational device, for example an artificial neural network in hardware. The computer runs a simulation model so faithful to the original that it will behave in essentially the same way as the original brain, or for all practical purposes, indistinguishable. [PARAGRAPH:2]Whole brain emulation is discussed as a logical endpoint  of the topical computational neuroscience and neuroinformatics fields, both about brain simulation for medical research purposes. It is discussed in artificial intelligence research publications as an approach to strong AI. Among futurists and within the transhumanist philosophy it is an important proposed life extension technology, originally suggested in biomedical literature in 1971. It is a central conceptual feature of numerous science fiction novels and films. Whole brain simulation is considered by some scientists as a theoretical and futurustic but possible technology. Substantial mainstream research and development are being done in relevant areas including development of faster computers, animal brain mapping and simulation, and information extraction from dynamically functioning brains. [PARAGRAPH:2]The human brain contains about 100 billion nerve cells called neurons, each individually linked to other neurons by way of connectors called axons and dendrites. Signals at the junctures (synapses) of these connections are transmitted by the release and detection of chemicals known as neurotransmitters. It is established neuroscience consensus that the human mind is a largely an emergent property of the information processing of this neural network.[PARAGRAPH:2]Importantly, many leading neuroscientists have stated they believe important functions performed by the mind, such as learning, memory, and consciousness, are due to purely physical and electrochemical processes in the brain and are governed by applicable laws.[PARAGRAPH:2]The concept of mind uploading is based on this mechanistic view of the mind, and also relies on certain assumptions about the nature of human consciousness and the philosophy of artificial intelligence.

		<English>[TAB]Wireless energy transfer or wireless power transmission is the process that takes place in any system where electrical energy is transmitted from a power source to an electrical load, without interconnecting wires in an electrical grid. Wireless transmission is ideal in cases where instantaneous or continuous energy transfer is needed, but interconnecting wires are inconvenient, hazardous, or impossible.[PARAGRAPH:2]Though the physics of both are identical, this is distinct from wireless transmission for the purpose of transferring information (such as radio) where the percentage of the power that is received is only important if it becomes too low to successfully recover the signal. With wireless energy transfer, the efficiency is a more critical parameter and this creates differences in these technologies.[PARAGRAPH:2]Wireless electric energy transfer for experimentally powering electric automobiles and buses is a higher power application (>10kW) of resonant inductive energy transfer. High power levels are required for rapid recharging and high energy transfer efficiency is required both for operational economy and to avoid negative environmental impact of the system. An experimental electrified roadway test track built circa 1990 achieved 80% energy efficiency while recharging the battery of a prototype bus at a specially equipped bus stop. The bus could be outfitted with a retractable receiving coil for greater coil clearance when moving. The gap between the transmit and receive coils was designed to be less than 10 cm when powered. In addition to buses the use of wireless transfer has been investigated for recharging electric automobiles in parking spots and garages as well.[PARAGRAPH:2]Some of these wireless resonant inductive devices operate at low milliwatt power levels and are battery powered. Others operate at higher kilowatt power levels. Current implantable medical and road electrification device designs achieve more than 75% transfer efficiency at an operating distance between the transmit and receive coils of less than 10 cm.[PARAGRAPH:2]In November 2006, Marin Soljacic and other researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology applied the near field behavior well known in electromagnetic theory to a wireless power transmission concept based on strongly-coupled resonators. In a theoretical analysis, they demonstrate that, by designing electromagnetic resonators that suffer minimal loss due to radiation and absorption and have a near field with mid-range extent (namely a few times the resonator size), mid-range efficient wireless energy-transfer is possible. The reason is that, if two such resonant circuits tuned to the same frequency are within a fraction of a wavelength, their near fields (consisting of 'evanescent waves') couple by means of evanescent wave coupling (which is related to quantum tunneling). Standing waves develop between the inductors, which can allow the energy to transfer from one object to the other within times much shorter than all loss times, which were designed to be long, and thus with the maximum possible energy-transfer efficiency. Since the resonant wavelength is much larger than the resonators, the field can circumvent extraneous objects in the vicinity and thus this mid-range energy-transfer scheme does not require line-of-sight. By utilizing in particular the magnetic field to achieve the coupling, this method can be safe, since magnetic fields interact weakly with living organisms.</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_TECH_TELEPORTATION_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB]Teleportation is the transfer of matter from one point to another, more or less instantaneously through technological artifice. One proposed means of teleportation is the transmission of data which is used to precisely reconstruct an object or organism at its destination. However, it would be impossible to travel from one point to another instantaneously; faster than light travel, as of today, is believed to be impossible. [PARAGRAPH:2]The use of this form of teleportation as a means of transport for humans still has considerable unresolved technical issues, such as recording the human body with sufficient accuracy to allow reproduction elsewhere, and whether destroying a human in one place and recreating a copy elsewhere would provide a sufficient experience of continuity of existence. The reassembled human might be considered a different sentience with the same memories as the original, as could be easily proved by constructing not just one, but several copies of the original and interrogating each as to the perceived uniqueness of each. Each copy constructed using merely descriptive data, but not matter, transmitted from the origin and new matter already at the destination point would consider itself to be the true continuation of the original and yet this could not logically be true; moreover, because each copy constructed via this data-only method would be made of new matter that already existed at the destination, there would be no way, even in principle, of distinguishing the original from the copies. Many of the relevant questions are shared with the concept of mind transfer. It is interesting to note, however, that quantum mechanics forbids one from making a wholly exact copy of an object: see no-cloning theorem and Heisenberg uncertainty principle.[PARAGRAPH:2]It is not clear if duplication of a human would require reproduction of the exact quantum state, which necessarily destroys the original, or whether macroscopic measurements would suffice. In the non-destructive version, hypothetically a new copy of the individual is created with each teleportation, with only the copy subjectively experiencing the teleportation. Technology of this type would have many other applications, such as virtual medicine (manipulating the stored data to create a copy better, or perhaps radically different, than the original), a sort of suspended animation (by creating a copy many years after the information was stored), or backup copies (creating a copy from recently stored information if the original was involved in a mishap.)</English>

In the first approach, a traditional model of a biological system will focus on capturing its most important parameters. In contrast, an alife modeling approach will generally seek to decipher the most simple and general principles underlying life and implement them in a simulation.

In the first approach, a traditional model of a biological system will focus on capturing its most important parameters. In contrast, an alife modeling approach will generally seek to decipher the most simple and general principles underlying life and implement them in a simulation. The simulation then offers the possibility to analyse new, different life-like systems. At present, the commonly accepted definition of life does not consider any current alife simulations or softwares to be alive, and they do not constitute part of the evolutionary process of any ecosystem. However, different opinions about artificial life's potential have arisen:[PARAGRAPH:2]The strong alife (cf. Strong AI) position states that "life is a process which can be abstracted away from any particular medium" (John von Neumann). Notably, Tom Ray declared that his program Tierra is not simulating life in a computer but synthesizing it.[PARAGRAPH:2]The weak alife position denies the possibility of generating a "living process" outside of a chemical solution. Its researchers try instead to simulate life processes to understand the underlying mechanics of biological phenomena.</Spanish>

		<English>[TAB]DNA computing is a form of computing which uses DNA, biochemistry and molecular biology, instead of the traditional silicon-based computer technologies. DNA computing, or, more generally, molecular computing, is a fast developing interdisciplinary area. Research and development in this area concerns theory, experiments and applications of DNA computing. [PARAGRAPH:2]DNA computing is fundamentally similar to parallel computing in that it takes advantage of the many different molecules of DNA to try many different possibilities at once. For certain specialized problems, DNA computers are faster and smaller than any other computer built so far. But DNA computing does not provide any new capabilities from the standpoint of computability theory, the study of which problems are computationally solvable using different models of computation. For example, if the space required for the solution of a problem grows exponentially with the size of the problem (EXPSPACE problems) on von Neumann machines it still grows exponentially with the size of the problem on DNA machines. For very large EXPSPACE problems, the amount of DNA required is too large to be practical. (Quantum computing, on the other hand, does provide some interesting new capabilities).</English>
