		<English>[H1]Fixed Borders[\H1][PARAGRAPH:2]With Fixed Borders, Units have new command "claim territory" that you can apply in an enemy territory. You claim it, next turn the plot is inside your borders. However, if your civ doesn’t have culture in a claimed tile, you must keep at least one unit on it each turn in order not to lose it again (i.e. if you claim tiles far from your cities, you must keep forces there to keep them).[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Forts as Cities:[\BOLD][NEWLINE] The point is that all forts really act as cities when it comes to culture and borders. They emit a minimal amount of culture in their adjacent tiles, thus enabling you to have additional territory without units far from cities, as long as you keep the forts under your control. You don’t even need units inside forts, but it’s like leaving a city unguarded. Once forts are captured (in war, like cities), they give the new owner the control of the surrounding tiles. There are some additional rules when a fort shares adjacent tile with a city – then the city is the ‘main owner’ of the tile and you must capture the city itself in order to get the adjacent tile (but the fort you get as soon as you capture it).[PARAGRAPH:2]During a war, if a tile has more of your tiles surrounding it than the enemys, it is claimed automatically, if no enemy units are defending it. This makes the borders less shredded at the end of war.[PARAGRAPH:2]Additional thing about borders around cities - every tile next to a city ALWAYS belongs to the owner of that city. This is an additional feature that could be good for plain BTS also, but with fixed borders it is a must (when a non-fixed-borders-civ captures a city of a fixed-borders-civ, it can have a lot of problems with that city, which is very soon completely surrounded by enemy tiles).[PARAGRAPH:2]If you are not using a civic that "forces" fixed borders, the game acts as before (i.e. the culture defines borders) and once a player has the necessary civics all of his territory becomes ‘fixed’, no one can take it by culture means anymore and his units get the new command to execute when in enemy territory (‘claim territory’). The player still culturally expands his borders over unoccupied territory and over nations that don’t have fixed borders (think of the Roman Empire that enforced its own borders, but influenced the surrounding tribes that had no solid state formed).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB][BOLD]Civics That enable "Fixed Borders":[\BOLD][NEWLINE](In order to have Fixed Civics, you must have at least one of the following) [NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_HEREDITARY_RULE]Monarchy[\LINK][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_FEDERAL]Federal[\LINK][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_COMMUNIST]Communism[\LINK][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_FASCIST]Fascist[\LINK][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_VASSALAGE]Vassalage[\LINK][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_PARLIAMENT]Parliament[\LINK][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_PRESIDENT]President[\LINK][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_NATIONALIST]Nationalist[\LINK][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_PLANNED]Planned[\LINK][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_CORPORATIST]Corporatist[\LINK][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_STATE_CHURCH]State Church[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:2]</English>
		<French>[H1]Frontières Fixes[\H1][PARAGRAPH:2]Avec Frontières Fixes, Les Unités ont une nouvelle action "Réclamer le territoire" qui est utilisable en territoire ennemi. Une fois cette case réclamée, elle fait partie de votre territoire. Cependant, si votre niveau culturel n'est pas suffisant, il vous faudra garder une unité sur la case pour continuer à la posséder. (de même, si vous réclamez des cases loin de vos Villes, il faudra garder des forces sur place).[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Forts :[\BOLD][NEWLINE] Les Forts se comportent comme des Villes en se qui concerne la culture et les frontières. Ils génèrent une faible quantité de culture sur les cases à proximité, ce qui vous permet de posséder ce territoire supplémentaire, tant que vous garder le fort sous contrôle. Il n'est pas nécessaire de maintenir d'unité dans le Fort, mais il vaut mieux ne pas les laisser sans surveillance. Lorsque les forts sont capturés (en tant de Guerre, comme les Villes), ils donnent le contrôles des cases adjacentes au vainqueur. Il y a quelques règles supplémentaires : par exemple, lorsqu'un fort partage une case avec une Ville, c'est la Ville qui garde le contrôle de cette case (Mais le fort a son propre propriétaire en cas de capture).[PARAGRAPH:2]En tant de Guerre, un case qui est entourée d'une majorité de vos cases par rapport à celles de l'ennemi sera automatiquement réclamée, s'il n'y a pas d'unités dessus. Cela permet des frontières plus homogène à la fin de la Guerre.[PARAGRAPH:2]Autre chose concernant les Frontières autour des Villes - Toutes les cases à proximité immédiate de la Ville appartiennent TOUJOURS au propriétaire de cette Ville. Cette fonctionnalité devrait être intéressante pour BTS, mais avec l'option Frontièrs Fixes, c'est nécessaire (afin de ne pas avoir de situations avec des villes sans aucune case à exploiter entre autre).[PARAGRAPH:2] Si la doctrine que vous utilisez ne spécifie pas de frontières fixes, le principe de la frontière culturelle du jeu original s'applique. Et lorsque le joueur a les doctrines lui attribuant des frontières fixes, les cases ne sont pas automatiquement converties par la culture. Les frontières s'étendent tout de même culturellement vers un territoire non occupé ou vers celui d'un joueur ne possédant pas de frontières fixes (exemple : l'Empire Romain qui entretenait ses propres frontières, mais en parallèle influençait les tribus autour qui n'avait de solide constitution).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB][BOLD]Doctrines qui activent les "Frontières Fixes" :[\BOLD][NEWLINE](au moins une des suivantes :) [NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_HEREDITARY_RULE]Monarchy[\LINK][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_FEDERAL]Fédéral[\LINK][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_COMMUNIST]Communisme[\LINK][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_FASCIST]Fascisme[\LINK][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_VASSALAGE]Vassalité[\LINK][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_PARLIAMENT]Parlement[\LINK][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_PRESIDENT]Président[\LINK][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_NATIONALIST]Nationalisme[\LINK][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_PLANNED]Planifié[\LINK][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_CORPORATIST]Corporatisme[\LINK][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_STATE_CHURCH]Eglise d'Etat[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:2]</French>

Players can use this expanded access to food to fuel thier specialist economy, drive their war machine, or to gain access to prevously locked resources. However, because the third ring of culture is now workable, this change makes maintaining your cultural borders more important. Losing access to some outer-ring mines may become the difference to defeat or failure in a war. In addition, players will face other new challenges. Because cities will reach much higher levels of population before running out of food, unhealthy and unhappy cities may become problematic. If poorly maintained, these larger cities may even decide to revel against your leadership. Players should spend extra effort to keep these mega-cities healthy and happy.[PARAGRAPH:2]</Spanish>

		<French>[H1]Corporations Réalistes[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]Corporations Réalistes donnent aux Corporations leur 'liberté', car elles ne sont plus controllées par l'état, mais constituent des entités indépendantes. Alors que l'état possède la Ville au sein de laquelle opère la corporation, ou le siège de la corporation, il ne peut plus contrôler sa propagation, sauf dans des circonstances extêmes. Aucune unité ne peut être crée pour propager les corporations, sauf dans le cas de certaines Doctrines qui bloquent les corporations étrangères. Les bâtiments corporatifs sont gérées automatiquement par le jeu, avec un peu d'aléatoire et de stratégie : à chaque tour, le jeu vérifie et essaie de fonder des corporations dans les endroits remplissant toutes les conditions requises. Parmi ces conditions, au moins 3 joueurs doivent avoir découvert les technologies pré-requises et avoir les ressources nécessaires. Les Corporations favorisent les Villes qui leur offrent la meilleure situation. Ainsi, posséder des villes avec la plupart, voire toutes les ressources requise pour les corporations peut être très bénéfique. Une fois le Siège fondé, Le principe de propagation s'apparente à celui des religions, favorisé par le réseau routier et les bénéfices que retire la Corporation de la Ville. Bien qu'il n'y ait plus de contrôle sur la propagation des Corporations, Le Joueur a tout de même un levier : au lieu de payer de l'entretien pour les Corporations, Il est possible de décider de taxer, ou alors de subventionner les corporations, réduisant ou au contraire favorisant leur expansion. Attention, si les Taxes des corporations sont trop importantes en comparaison des autres Nations, les corporations peuvent décider de fermer leur activité dans vos villes.[PARAGRAPH:2]</French>
