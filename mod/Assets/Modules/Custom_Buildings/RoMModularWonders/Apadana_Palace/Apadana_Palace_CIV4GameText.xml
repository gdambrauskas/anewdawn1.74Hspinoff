		<English>Darius the Great built the greatest and most glorious palace at Persepolis in the western side. This palace was called the Apadana.  The King of Kings used it for official audiences. The work began in 515 BC. His son Xerxes I completed it 30 years later. The palace had a grand hall in the shape of a square, each side 60 m long with seventy-two columns, thirteen of which still stand on the enormous platform. Each column is 19 m high with a square Taurus and plinth. The columns carried the weight of the vast and heavy ceiling. The tops of the columns were made from animal sculptures such as two headed bulls, lions and eagles. The columns were joined to each other with the help of oak and cedar  beams, which were brought from Lebanon. The walls were covered with a layer of mud and stucco to a depth of 5 cm, which was used for bonding, and then covered with the greenish stucco which is found throughout the palaces. At the western, northern and eastern sides of the palace there was a rectangular veranda which had twelve columns in two rows of six. At the south of the grand hall a series of rooms were built for storage. Two grand Persepolitan stairways were built, symmetrical to each other and connected to the stone foundations. To protect the roof from erosion, vertical drains were built through the brick walls. In the four corners of Apadana, facing outwards, four towers were built.

The walls were tiled and decorated with pictures of lions, bulls, and flowers. Darius ordered his name and the details of his empire to be written in gold and silver on plates, which were placed in covered stone boxes in the foundations under the Four Corners of the palace. Two Persepolitan style symmetrical stairways were built on the northern and eastern sides of Apadana to compensate for a difference in level. Two other stairways stood in the middle of the building. The external front views of the palace were embossed with pictures of the Immortals, the Kings' elite guards. The northern stairway was completed during Darius' reign, but the other stairway was completed much later.</English>
		<French>Darius Ie (le Grand) a construit le plus Grand et glorieux Palais de la Perse. Le roi l'a fait bâtir durant les premières années de son règne. Le palais s'inspire de ceux de la période néo-babylonienne en ce qui concerne l'organisation des salles dans la Maison du Roi, avec sa succession de cours intérieures alignées, et le plan des salles. Mais il présente aussi des originalités, comme les salles carrées soutenues par quatre colonnes qui seront reprises ensuite à Persépolis. Du point de vue des matériaux, on voit le mélange de la technique mésopotamienne, donc susienne (briques crues, cuites, émaillées), et de celle des montagnards perses (bois et pierre). L’Apadana, salle d’audience royale, a été construit au nord du palais. Il s’agit d’un grand édifice (12 000 m²), de base carrée (109 mètres de côté) ; elle s’organise autour d’une salle centrale carrée (58 mètres de côté), dont le plafond est supporté par six rangées de six colonnes, qui ont une base carrée, et devaient s’élever à 19 mètres. Ces colonnes étaient couronnées d’un chapiteau à protomé de taureau, où s’encastraient les poutres du plafond. Les côtés ouest, nord et est de l'Apadana permettaient d'accéder par des portes à double battants à trois portiques (avec chacun deux rangées de six colonnes). Quatre tours avaient été bâties aux angles de l’édifice.</French>
