		<English>Banditry is a weak form of military, typically associated weak city-state governments. Bandits do not often form large groups and generally ignore the provisions of government. For these reasons it is nearly impossible to successfully base a powerful military off of bandits due to their solitary behavior and mistrust of all.</English>

		<English>A vassal is one who enters into mutual obligations with a monarch, usually of military support and mutual protection, in exchange for certain guarantees, which came to include the terrain held as a fief. By analogy it is applied to similar systems in other feudal societies. It was always distinct from fidelitas, sworn loyalty of subject to king, and the honor, the respect and consideration that accrued to the vassal, unlike the delegated power of a comes or count, was not expressed in expectations of related public duty.</English>
