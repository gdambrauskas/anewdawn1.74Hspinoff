		<English>An arsenal is an establishment for the construction, repair, storage and issue of weapons and ammunition. The word is of Arabic origin, being a corruption of dar as-sina'ah, "house of manufacturing" or "manufacture".A first-class arsenal, which can furnish the material and equipment of a large army, embraces a gun factory, carriage factory, laboratory and small-arms ammunition factory, small-arms factory, harness, saddlery and tent factories, and a powder factory; in addition it must possess great store-houses. In a second-class arsenal the factories would be replaced by workshops. The situation of an arsenal should be governed by strategic considerations. If of the first class, it should be situated at the base of operations and supply, secure from attack, not too near a frontier, and placed so as to draw in readily the resources of the country.</English>
