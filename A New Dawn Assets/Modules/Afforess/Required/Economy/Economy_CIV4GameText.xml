		<English>In law and economics, insurance is a form of risk management primarily used to hedge against the risk of a contingent, uncertain loss. Insurance is defined as the equitable transfer of the risk of a loss, from one entity to another, in exchange for payment. An insurer is a company selling the insurance; an insured or policyholder is the person or entity buying the insurance policy. The insurance rate is a factor used to determine the amount to be charged for a certain amount of insurance coverage, called the premium. Risk management, the practice of appraising and controlling risk, has evolved as a discrete field of study and practice.</English>
		<French>En droit et en économie, l'assurance est une forme de gestion des risques, principalement utilisé pour se prémunir contre le risque d'une perte incertaine et contingente. L'assurance est définie comme le transfert équitable du risque de cette perte, d'une entité à une autre, en échange de paiement. L'assureur est une entreprise qui vend de l'assurance, un assuré ou preneur d'assurance est la personne physique ou morale achetant la police d'assurance. Le taux d'assurance est un facteur servant à déterminer le montant à payer pour une certaine quantité de la couverture d'assurance, appelé prime. La gestion des risques, la pratique de l'évaluation et du contrôle du risque, a évolué comme un champ distinct d'étude théorique et pratique.</French>

		<English>A derivative is an agreement or contract that is not based on a real, or true, exchange, i.e.: There is nothing tangible like money, or a product, that is being exchanged. For example, a person goes to the grocery store, exchanges a currency (money) for a commodity (say, an apple). The exchange is complete, both parties have something tangible. If the purchaser had called the store and asked for the apple to be held for one hour while the purchaser drives to the store, and the seller agrees, then a derivative has been created. The agreement (derivative) is derived from a proposed exchange (trade money for apple in one hour, not now).</English>
		<French>Un produit dérivé est un accord ou un contrat qui n'est pas fondée sur un véritable échange de biens réels : Il n'y a rien de tangible comme de l'argent, ou un produit, qui est échangé. Par exemple, une personne va à l'épicerie, échange de la monnaie (de l'argent) pour un produit (par exemple, une pomme). L'échange est terminé, les deux parties ont quelque chose de tangible. Si l'acheteur a appelé le magasin et a demandé que la pomme lui soit réservé pendant une heure le temps que l'acheteur arrive au magasin, et le vendeur accepte, alors un produit dérivé a été créé. L'accord (dérivé) est dérivé d'un échange proposé (commerce de l'argent pour la pomme dans une heure, pas maintenant).</French>
