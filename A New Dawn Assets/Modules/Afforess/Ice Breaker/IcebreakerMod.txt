IceBreaker Mod for Civilization 4 version 1.52

Version number: 1.00
Release date: January 12, 2005

Made by Optimizer

*** DESCRIPTION

This mod makes the ocean ice dynamic. Ice can occasionally grow and disappear, so that arctic passages can be open during one turn and closed during another.

The ice can be crossed by Workboats, but the high movement cost allows them to move only one tile a turn through ice.

With Combustion, Workboats will become able to break the ice. This will be very useful for opening passages.
