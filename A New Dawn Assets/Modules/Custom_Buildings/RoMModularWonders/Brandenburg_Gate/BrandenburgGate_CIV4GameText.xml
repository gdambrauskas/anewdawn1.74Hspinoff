		<English>[TAB]The Brandenburg Gate is a former city gate and one of the main symbols of Berlin, Germany. It constitutes the monumental termination of Unter den Linden, the renowned boulevard of linden trees which led directly to the royal residence. It was commissioned by Friedrich Wilhelm II as a sign of peace and built by Carl Gotthard Langhans from 1788 to 1791. The Brandenburg Gate's design has remained unchanged since its completion, yet it has played different political roles in German history. After the 1806 Prussian defeat at the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt, Napoleon stole and took the Quadriga to Paris, however, after his defeat in 1814 and the Prussian Parisian occupation by General Ernst von Pfuel, the Quadriga was restored to Berlin, and Viktoria's olive wreath exchanged for the Iron Cross, becoming goddess of victory. When the Nazis ascended to power, they used the Gate as their symbol. The Gate, itself, survived World War II and was one of few structures standing in the Pariser Platz ruins. The governments of East Berlin and West Berlin restored it, however, it was closed when the Berlin Wall was erected in 1961. When the Revolutions of 1989 collapsed the Berlin Wall, the Gate then symbolized the freedom to unity of the City of Berlin.</English>
		<French>La porte de Brandebourg (Brandenburger Tor en allemand) se situe à l'entrée ouest de l'ancien Berlin et est un symbole de la ville. Elle fut érigée par Carl Gotthard Langhans (1732-1808) pour le roi prussien Frédéric-Guillaume II de Prusse (1744-1797), en signe de paix. Elle fut construite de 1788 à 1791 en style néoclassique. Elle rappelle le Propylée de l'Acropole d'Athènes. Tous les événements importants de l'histoire de Berlin sont liés à la porte de Brandebourg comme symbole de la ville mais aussi de l'État. En 1793, elle est couronnée du quadrige de Johann Gottfried Schadow (1764-1850) figurant la déesse de la Victoire sur un char tiré par quatre chevaux. Cette statue a été réalisée en cuivre. En 1806, elle est emportée par Napoléon qui veut l'installer à Paris. Après la chute du Premier Empire, le quadrige retourne à Berlin, où il est restauré et agrémenté d'un nouveau symbole de pouvoir (l'aigle prussien). Après la Seconde Guerre mondiale, lors de la partition de la ville, la porte de Brandebourg se retrouve dans la Zone est. Avec la construction du mur de Berlin, le 13 août 1961, celle-ci se retrouve au milieu du No Man's Land gardé par les soldats de RDA et ne peut donc plus être traversée ni à l'est ni à l'ouest. C'est sous la pression de plus de 100 000 personnes que 28 ans après sa construction, le mur fut enfin rouvert au niveau de la porte le 22 décembre 1989, et elle symbolise à présent la liberté et l'unité de la Ville de Berlin.</French>
