Modular Wonders for Rise of Mankind 2.8 by generalstaff, version 1.01

Installation:
Unzip and make sure that the "RoMModularWonders" folder is put in the "Custom_Buildings" folder in the "Rise of Mankind" folder.
I compressed this mod so that it can be unzipped in the "Beyond the Sword/Mods" folder.
Readmes can obviously be moved where you want to store them or deleted (the latter is not recommended)

The Porcelain Tower has a new building sound, running the woc_installer.jar is necessary if you want it.

RoMModularWonders contains all the wonders, which are in separate folders, allowing you to play with only the wonders you want, and allowing me to early as more as new graphics are created.
