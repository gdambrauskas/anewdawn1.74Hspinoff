These buildings are designed for Snail games in order to make those more interesting.  They all become obsolete and produce no culture, which means they should not be unbalance a game.
Be sure to use the Abondon City function to "sell" these buildings when they become obsolete if the clutter bothers you.

Conflicts:
Anything that adds another resource.
