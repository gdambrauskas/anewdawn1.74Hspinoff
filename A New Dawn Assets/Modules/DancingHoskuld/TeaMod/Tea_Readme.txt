Tea Mod by - Dancing Hoskuld

This mod makes Tea and Insence a bit more realistic.  this is a very simple XML only mod.

I made the Tea component modular from a post by Chiyochan's 

" not all resources are equal (tea)
with the final addition of tea, i was a little flabbergasted at the absolute 0 health boost it gives, RoM already has resources that where unequal, so i thought it was time to shake things up a bit more and give tea its rightful place
it adds +2 to health from plantation, along with the +1 happiness
and switches the +1 happiness bonuses from building to health, "

I found that the AI was still not working Insence so I made it an optional requirement for the bazzar like pearls are.
